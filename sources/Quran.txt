Surely, those who believe, 
those who are Jewish, 
the Christians, 
the converts; 
anyone who 
(1) believes in God, and 
(2) believes in the Hereafter, and (3) leads a righteous life, 
will receive their recompense from their Lord; they have nothing to fear, nor will they grieve.

Proclaiming 
One Uniﬁed Religion 
for All the People 
All religions of the world - Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and others - have been severely corrupted through innovations, traditions, and the idolization of humans such as the prophets and the saints. 
God's plan, as stated in the Old Testament (Malachi 3:1), the New Testament (Luke 17:22-36 & Matthew 24:27), and this Final Testament ( 3:81 ), calls for the sending of God's Messenger of the Covenant after all the scriptures have been delivered. The main function of God's Messenger of the Covenant is to purify the scriptures and unify them into one universal message to this world from the Creator and Sustainer of this world. 
This major scriptural prophecy has now been ful ﬁlled. God's Messenger of the Covenant has arrived, supported by overwhelming tangible proof (see Appendix Two). The puriﬁcation and uniﬁcation process has begun. God's plan is supported by God's invisible forces, and the enormous dimensions of this divine plan is manifest in the recent exposure of false religionists, and the removal of such anti-freedom barriers as the Berlin Wall, the Iron Curtain, and the bamboo curtain. 
Henceforth, there is only one religion acceptable to God - Submission. Anyone who submits to God and devotes the worship to God ALONE is a "Submitter." Thus, one may be a Jewish Submitter, a Christian Submitter, a Buddhist Submitter, a Hindu Submitter, or a Muslim Submitter. 
The only religion acceptable to God is Submission. [ 3:19 ] 
Anyone who seeks other than Submission as his religion, it will not be accepted from him and, in the Hereafter, he will be with the losers.

[ 3:85 ] 
(Rashad Khalifa, November, 1989) 
A prophet like me will the Lord, your God, raise up for you from among your kinsmen; to him you shall listen. (Moses in Deuteronomy 18:15) 
I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their kinsmen, and will put My words into his mouth; he shall tell them all that I command him. If any man will not listen to My words which he speaks in My name, I Myself will make him answer for it. (Deuteronomy 18:18-19) 
I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Paraclete - to be with you always: THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH. (Jesus in John 14:16-17) 
When THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH comes to you, he will guide you to all truth, and will announce to you the things to come. (Jesus on John 16:13) 
God's Messenger of the Covenant 
Lo, I am sending My messenger to prepare the way before Me; and suddenly there will come to the temple the Lord whom you seek, and the messenger of the covenant whom you desire. Yes, he is coming, says the Lord of hosts. But who will endure the day of his coming? And who can stand when he appears? For he is like the re ﬁner's ﬁre ... he will sit purifying .... (Malachi 3:1-3) 
When God ALONE is mentioned, the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter shirink with aversion. But when others are mention- ed besides Him, they rejoice. [ 39:45 ]

On the 27th night of Ramadan, 13 B.H. (Before Hijra) (610 A.D.), the prophet Muhammad (the soul - the real person - not the body) was summoned to the highest possible point, millions of light years from the planet Earth, and this Quran was placed into his heart ( 2:185 , 17:1 , 44:3 , 53:1 -18, 97:1 ). 
Subsequently, the Quran was released into Muhammad's memory, with Gabriel's mediation, over a period of 23 years, 610 to 632 A.D. ( 17:106 ). At the moment of release, Muhammad scrupulously wrote it down with his own hand (Appendix 28 ). What Muhammad left was the complete Quran, written in the chronological sequence of revelation, with detailed instructions for putting the revelations into the sequence decreed by God. 
During the re-arrangement process, the scribes who idolized the Prophet added two verses at the end of Sura 9 , the last sura revealed in Medina. This blasphemous act resulted in a 50-year war between Ali Ibn Abi Taaleb and his supporters on one side and the distorters of the Quran on the other side. The war ended when Hussein ibn Ali and his family were martyred in Karbala. 
It was the Umayyad ruler Marwan Ibn Al-Hakam (died in 684 AD) who destroyed the original Quran that was written by Muhammad's hand, "fearing the eruption of new disputes." 
God's Messenger of the Covenant has presented overwhelming evidence that 9:128-129 do not belong in the Quran (Appendix 24 ). With the removal of these false verses, the Quran has ﬁnally been restored. Our generation is the ﬁrst ever to receive the Quran in its puri ﬁed and ﬁnalized form (see Appendix 1 and 28 ).

INTRODUCTION 
In the name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful 
This is God's ﬁnal message to humanity. All of God's prophets have come to this world, and all the scriptures have been delivered. The time has come to purify and consolidate all the messages delivered by God's prophets into one message, and to proclaim that henceforth, there is only one religion acceptable to God, "Submission" ( 3:19 , 85). "Submission" is the religion whereby we recognize God's absolute authority, and reach an unshakeable conviction that God ALONE possesses all power; no other entity possesses any power that is independent of Him. The natural result of such a realization is to devote our lives and our worship absolutely to God ALONE. This is the First Commandment in all the scriptures, including the Old Testament, the New Testament, and this Final Testament. 
While every religion has been corrupted by innovations, traditions, and 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 13 -----------------------------------------------------
false, idolatrous doctrines, there may be "Submitters" within every religion. There may be Submitters who are Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, or anything else. These Submitters, collectively, constitute the only religion acceptable to God. As emphasized by the theme on the front page of this book, all Submitters who are devoted to God ALONE, and do not set up any idols beside God, are redeemed into God's eternal kingdom ( 2:62 ). A criterion of the true submitters is that they will ﬁnd nothing objectionable in the Quran. 
With the advent of this Testament, God's message to the world is now complete. We have now received the long awaited answers to our most urgent questions - who we are, the purpose of our lives, how we came into this world, where do we go from here, which religion is the right one, was it evolution or creation, etc. 
Some may wonder: "Why did God wait all this time to perfect and consolidate His message? What about all the people since Adam who did not receive the complete scripture?" Bearing in mind that the Quran answers this question in 20:52 , it is a matter of simple statistics that the world's population from the beginning until now did not exceed 7,000,000,000. From now to the end of the world, 2280 A.D. (Appendix 25 ), it is estimated that the total world population will exceed 75,000,000,000. Thus, the vast majority of people are destined to receive God's puri ﬁed and consolidated message (see diagram). 
World population from now (1990) to the end of the world (2280). 
[ The black section represents the world population since Adam ] 
Before Genesis 
It all began a few billion years ago when one of God's high-ranking creatures, Satan, developed a supercilious idea that he could run a dominion as an independent god besides God. This challenge to God's absolute authority was not only blasphemous, it was also erroneous. Satan was ignorant of the fact that God alone possesses the ability to be a god, and that 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 14 -----------------------------------------------------
there is much more to godhood than he realized. It was the ego - arrogance augmented by ignorance - that led Satan to believe that he could take care of a dominion, as a god, and run it without disease, misery, war, accidents, and chaos. The vast majority of God's creatures disagreed with Satan. Yet, the minute egoistic minority that agreed with him in various extents were in the billions. Thus, a profound dispute erupted within the Heavenly Community ( 38:69 ). The rebels' unjustiﬁable challenge to God's absolute authority was met and resolved in the most efﬁcient manner. After giving the rebels sufﬁcient chances to denounce their crime and submit to Him, God decided to exile the hard core rebels on a space ship called Earth, and give them yet another chance to redeem themselves. 
If you claim that you can ﬂy a plane, the best way to test your claim is to give you a plane and ask you to ﬂy it. This is precisely what God decided to do in response to Satan's claim that he could be a god; God appointed him a temporary god on the tiny speck Earth ( 2:30 , 36:60 ). As for those who agreed with Satan, they were given a chance to kill their egos and submit to God's absolute authority. While the vast majority of the guilty creatures took advantage of this opportunity, a miniscule minority consisting of about 150 billion creatures failed to take advantage of this offer ( 33:72 ). 
The dispute in the Heavenly Community led to the classiﬁcation of God's creatures into different categories: 
(1) The Angels 
Creatures who never questioned God's absolute authority were classiﬁed as angels; they knew that God alone possesses the ability and qualiﬁcations to 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 15 -----------------------------------------------------
be a god. The vast majority of God's creatures - countless numbers - belong in this category. The number of angels is so enormous, even the angels do not know how many of them there are; only God knows their number ( 74:31 ). 
(2) The Animals 
Although the angels suggested that the rebels and their leader should be exiled from God's kingdom ( 2:30 ), the Most Merciful willed to give the rebels a chance to denounce their crime, repent, and submit to His absolute authority ( 33:72 ). As represented in the diagram above, the vast majority of the rebels took advantage of God's gracious offer to re-enter His kingdom. They agreed to kill their egos, come to this world to perform a submissive role, as an expiation for their blasphemy. In return for their submissive role in this world, these creatures are redeemed back to God's eternal kingdom ( 6:38 ). The horse, the dog, the tree, the sun, the moon, the stars, as well as deformed and retarded children are among the intelligent creatures who denounced their crime and repented: 
The horse has no ego. The horse's owner can be rich or poor, tall or short, fat or thin, young or old, and the horse will serve them all. The dog has no ego; it will wag its tail to its owner, no matter how rich or poor the owner 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 16 -----------------------------------------------------
might be. The sun rises and sets every day at precisely the times prescribed by God. The moon follows its synchronized orbit around the earth, without the slightest deviation. The human body - a temporary garment - belongs to the Earth; as such, it is a submitter. The heart, lungs, kidneys, and other organs, perform their functions without our control. 
(3) The Humans 
The hard-core rebels - humans and jinns - refused to denounce their crime, and opted for witnessing a demonstration of Satan's claim. These egotistic creatures who failed to submit to God's absolute authority, even when offered a chance to do so, were divided in half. The half that were less convinced of Satan's point of view became classiﬁed as humans. Although they harbored doubts about Satan's claim, they failed to make a ﬁrm stand regarding God's absolute authority. It is the ego that prevented these creatures from appreciating God's omnipotence, it is the ego that prevented them from submitting when such an opportunity was offered to them ( 33:72 ), and it is the ego that stands between most of us and redemption to God's kingdom ( 25:43 ). This is why "Kill your ego" is one of the ﬁrst commandments in the Quran ( 2:54 ). 
(4) The Jinns 
The other half of the guilty creatures, those who leaned closer to Satan's point of view and exhibited the biggest egos, became classiﬁed as jinns. It was God's plan to assign one jinn to every human being from birth to death. The jinn companion represents Satan and constantly promotes his point of view ( 50:23 , 27). Both the jinns and the humans are given a precious chance in this world to re-educate themselves, denounce their egoism, and redeem themselves by submitting to God's absolute authority. Whenever a human being is born, a jinn is born and is assigned to the new human. We learn from the Quran that the jinns are Satan's descendants ( 7:27 , 18:50 ). When a jinn being is born and assigned to a human being, the jinn remains a constant companion of the human until the human dies. The jinn is then freed, and lives on for a few centuries. Both humans and jinns are required 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 17 -----------------------------------------------------
to worship God alone ( 51:56 ). 
God Does Not Want Robots 
The dispute in the Heavenly Community as stated in 38:69 and described proves that God's creatures possess the freedom of choice; they have minds of their own. The rebellion of a miniscule minority among God's creatures has served to emphasize the wonderful fact that God's creatures serve Him because they appreciate His inﬁnite magni ﬁcence. Without the rebellion, we would have never known that freedom is God's gift to His creatures. 
Most Gracious, Most Merciful 
Even in our worldly dimension, any enterprise expects its employees to be loyal and devoted to the welfare of the enterprise. If an employee is not totally dedicated to the enterprise, or is shown to have divided loyalties, he is immediately dismissed. Since the humans and the jinns sided with Satan, then turned down God's offer to reconsider their rebellious acts, the angels expected Satan and his allies to be banished from God's kingdom ( 2:30 ). It was immense mercy from God that He granted us this additional chance to denounce our crime and redeem ourselves. 
To carry out this extremely merciful plan of redemption, God "created death" ( 67:1 -2). The divine plan called for bringing the rebels into another existence, where they have no recollection of the heavenly feud. Under the circumstances of this life, the humans and the jinns receive both God's messages and Satan's messages, then freely choose either side. Based on their freewill decision, they are either redeemed into God's kingdom, or become permanently exiled with Satan. 
Satan's Temporary Dominion 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 18 -----------------------------------------------------
To emphasize the utter insigniﬁcance of Satan's projected dominion, God created a billion galaxies, a billion trillion stars, within a vast universe that spans billions of light years. If we travel towards the Sun (93,000,000 miles) at the speed of light, we will reach it in eight minutes. If we keep going, we will reach the border of our Milky Way Galaxy after 50-70,000 years at the speed of light. To reach the nearest galaxy, it will take us 2,000,000 years at the speed of light, and there are at least 2,000,000,000 galaxies in "our universe." With the most powerful telescopes, the earth is utterly invisible from the edge of our own galaxy, let alone from the edge of our universe. As if our universe were not vast enough, God created six more, even larger universes surrounding our universe ( 2:29 , 67:3 ). God then informed Satan that a tiny mote within the smallest and innermost universe, the planet Earth, shall be his dominion. God's plan called for placing the humans and jinns in a universe that cannot stand His physical presence ( 7:143 ). Thus, Satan rules his minute kingdom far from the physical presence of God, though with God's full knowledge and control. It should also be noted that the number of rebels who repented was so vast, that the planet earth could not possibly accommodate all of them. As it is, the animals vastly outnumber the humans on this planet. It would take an unmanageable earth to accommodate all the repentant rebels. Hence the placement of uncountable decillions of creatures in outer space. 
Adam and Eve 
The body of the ﬁrst human being was shaped on earth by God's angels, in accordance with God's instructions ( 7:11 ). God then assigned the ﬁrst person, Adam, to that body. When God informed the angels that they will be serving the humans throughout the test period - guarding them, driving the winds, distributing the rain and provisions, etc. - Satan was the only one who refused to "fall prostrate" ( 2:34 , 15:31 , 38:74 ). Adam's mate was cloned, with feminine features, from Adam, and God assigned the second human being to her body. While the empty (soulless) bodies of Adam and Eve remained here on earth, their souls, the real persons, resided in Heaven. Adam and Eve remained in Heaven for as long as they upheld God's commandments. Once they listened to Satan instead, they reﬂected a ﬂawed 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 19 -----------------------------------------------------
human nature in all of us, and they immediately belonged to Satan's dominion down on Earth - "their bodies became visible to them" ( 7:20 , 20:121 ). The rest is history. 
Satan: Father of All the Jinns 
Putting the jinns and the humans to the test stipulated that Satan shall reproduce whenever a human being is born. As mentioned above, every time a human being is born, a jinn being is born to serve as a constant companion of the human person. Every human being is subjected to the incessant persuasions of Satan's representative who lives in the same body from birth to death. Satan's representative tries to convince the human companion of Satan's point of view: that God alone is not enough. On the Day of Judgment, the jinn companion serves as a witness against the human counterpart ( 43:38 ; 50:23 , 27). Many jinn companions are converted to God's point of view by the human companions. 
God did not leave the human being without preparation. To help the humans in their ﬁnal chance to reconsider their blasphemy, every person is born with instinctive knowledge that God ALONE, and no one else, is our Lord and Master ( 7:172 -173). The jinns were not given this instinctive knowledge, but they are given a much longer life span and greater abilities to study God's signs throughout the innermost universe. Since they represent Satan's point of view, their instinctive nature leans strongly in favor of polytheism. In addition to our built-in instinct to worship God alone, God sent messengers to help us redeem ourselves. With all these elements in view, we can appreciate the fact that the only unforgivable offense (if maintained until death) is idol worship: believing that anyone besides God possesses any power. 
Forty Years Grace Period 
The human being is given forty years to study, look around, re ﬂect, and examine all points of view before making this most important decision - to 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 20 -----------------------------------------------------
uphold Satan's point of view, or God's absolute authority. Anyone who dies before the age of forty is chosen by God for redemption due to circumstances known only to God. Anyone who dies before the age of 40 goes to Heaven ( 46:15 , Appendix 32 ). God's immense mercy is evident from the fact that even those who believe in the Quran ﬁnd it difﬁcult to accept such a compassionate divine law. 
God's messengers delivered the good news of our God-given chance to redeem ourselves, and they were supported by formidable signs. When Moses went to Pharaoh, he was supported by such miracles as the turning of his staff into a serpent. Jesus created live birds from clay by God's leave, healed the leprous and the blind by God's leave, and revived the dead by God's leave. The prophet Muhammad, God's messenger who delivered this Final Testament, did not exhibit such miracles ( 10:20 ). The Quran itself was the miracle supporting Muhammad's mission ( 29:50 -51). It was divine wisdom that separated the Miracle of the Quran from Muhammad by 14 centuries. Now that we understand the momentous dimensions of the Quran's mathematical miracle (Appendix 1 ), we realize that millions of people would have worshiped Muhammad as God incarnate if this Miracle were revealed through him. 
Proof of Authenticity: 
Physical, Tangible, Irrefutable. 
With the advent of the computer age, we discover that the Quran's mathematical code is "One of the great miracles" as stated in 74:30 -35. While the miracles given to previous messengers were limited in time and place, the Quran's miracle is perpetual. Only a few people witnessed the miracles of Moses and Jesus, but the Quran's miracle can be witnessed by anyone at any time. Furthermore, the Quran's miracle documents and proves all the previous miracles ( 5:48 ). 
As detailed in Appendix 1 , the Quran's mathematical miracle is based on the number "19." To share this awesome miracle with the reader, the word 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 21 -----------------------------------------------------
"GOD" is printed throughout the English text in bold capital letters, and the cumulative number of occurrences is shown at the lower left corner of every page. The total occurrence of this most important word is shown at the end of the Quran to be 2698. This total is a multiple of 19. Additionally, when we add the numbers assigned to every verse where the word "God" occurs, the total comes to 118123, also a multiple of 19 (19x6217). The cumulative sum of verse numbers where the word "God" occurs is shown on the lower right corner of every page. These simple physical facts are easily veriﬁable by the reader, and they suf ﬁce to prove the super-human nature of the Quran's mathematical composition. 
Total Count of the Word "God" 
(Shown at the lower left corner of every page) 
2698 (19x142) 
Total Sum of Verse Numbers (Shown at the lower right corner) 
118123 (19x6217) 
Proof of Authenticity to be Veri ﬁed by the Reader 
In addition to the Quran's extraordinary mathematical composition, we ﬁnd a large number of Quranic facts which are proven or theorized bymodern science. Here are a few examples of such advance scienti ﬁcinformation: 
The earth is egg-shaped ( 39:5 , 79:30 ). 
The earth is not standing still; it moves constantly ( 27:88 ). 
The sun is a source of light, while the moon re ﬂects it ( 10:5 , 25:61 , 71:16 ). 
The proportion of oxygen diminishes as we climb towards the sky ( 6:125 ). 
The "Big Bang Theory" is conﬁrmed ( 21:30 ). 
The "Expansion of the Universe Theory" is conﬁrmed ( 51:47 ). 
The universe started out as a gaseous mass ( 41:11 ). 
Evolution is a fact; within a given species, evolution is a divinely guided process ( 21:30 , 24:45 , 32:7 -9, 18:37 , 15:28 -29, 7:11 , 71:13 -14, Appendix 31). 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 22 -----------------------------------------------------
The man's seminal ﬂuid decides the baby's gender ( 53:45 -46). 
No Nonsense 
Equally miraculous is the absence of any nonsense in the Quran. This is particularly signiﬁcant in view of the dominance of ignorance and superstition at the time of revelation of the Quran. For example, the most respected exegesis among the traditional Muslims is that of Ibn Kathir. In this famous reference, written centuries after the Prophet, we read that the earth is carried on 40,000 horns of a giant bull, who stands on top of a giant whale (see Ibn Kathir's interpretation of Verse 68:1 ). 
As recently as 1975, and in the same location where the Quran was revealed, the president of the Islamic University of Medina, Saudi Arabia, Sheikh Abdul Aziz Ben Baz, declared that the earth is ﬂat and standing still (see insert)!! 
Translation from Ben Baz' book, Page 23: "If the earth is rotating as they claim, the countries, the mountains, the trees, the rivers, and the oceans will have no bottom and the people will see the eastern countries move to the west and the western countries move to the east." 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 23 -----------------------------------------------------
Perfect Happiness: Now and Forever 
One of the most elusive objectives of every human being is "Happiness." The Quran reveals the secret of attaining perfect happiness in this life and forever. We learn from the Quran that happiness is an exclusive quality of the soul. Thus, a body that attains all the material successes it longs for - money, power, fame, etc. - often belongs to an unhappy person. Happiness depends totally on the degree of growth and development attained by the soul, the real person. The Quran provides a detailed map towards perfect happiness for both body and soul, both in this world and in the eternal Hereafter (Appendix 15). 
In the numerous verses throughout this proven Testament, God personally guarantees the believers' happiness, now and forever: 
Absolutely, God's allies will have nothing to fear, 
nor will they grieve. 
They are those who believe 
and lead a righteous life. 
For them happiness in this life, 
and in the Hereafter. 
Such is God's inviolable law. 
This is the true triumph [10:62-64] 
All Believers Constitute the One Acceptable Religion 
As expected from the Creator's ﬁnal message, one of the prominent themes in the Quran is the call for unity among all believers, and the repeated prohibition of making any distinction among God's messengers. If the object of worship is one and the same, there will be absolute unity among all believers. It is the human factor, i.e., devotion and prejudice to such powerless humans as Jesus, Muhammad, and the saints that causes division, hatred, and bitter wars among the misguided believers. A guided believer is devoted to God ALONE, and rejoices in seeing any other believer who is 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 24 -----------------------------------------------------
devoted to God ALONE, regardless of the name such a believer calls his or her religion. 
Surely, those who believe, 
those who are Jewish, 
the Christians, 
and the converts; 
anyone who 
(1) believes in God, 
(2) believes in the Last Day, and 
(3) leads a righteous life, 
will receive their recompense from their Lord; 
they have nothing to fear, nor will they grieve. [ 2:62 , 5:69 ] 
God's Messenger of the Covenant 
As detailed in Appendix 2 , the publication of this book marks the advent of a new era - the era where God's messages, delivered by all His prophets, are consolidated into one. God's one and only religion, "Submission," shall dominate all other religions ( 9:33 , 48:28 , and 61:9 ). Today's corrupted religions, including Judaism, Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Islam, will simply die out, and "Submission" will prevail. This is not the wishful thinking of a human being or a collection of humans; this is God's inviolable law ( 3:19 , 9:33 , 41:53 , 48:28 , 61:9 , 110:1 ).

Sura 1: The Key (Al-Fatehah) - 
ا 
ﺴ ﻢ ا ﺮ ﻦ ا ﺮ ﺣ ﻴ ﻢ 
[1:1] In the name of  GOD , Most Gracious, Most Merciful.* 
*1:1 The ﬁrst verse in the Quran represents the foundation upon which a superhuman 19-based mathematical miracle is built. This important statement consists of 19 Arabic letters, and every word in it occurs in the whole Quran in multiples of 19 (see Appendices  1  &  29  for the details). 
*1:1-7 Sura 1 is God's gift to us to establish contact with Him through the daily Contact Prayers. This fact is supported by an earth-shattering, simple-to-understand-but-impossible-to-imitate mathematical composition that challenges the greatest mathematicians on earth, and stumps them; it is far beyond human capabilities: 
(1) The sura number, followed by the numbers of verses, next to each other, give 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7. This number is a multiple of 19. 
(2) If we substitute the number of letters per verse in place of the verse numbers, we get 1 19 17 12 11 19 18 43. This number is also a multiple of 19. 
(3) If we insert the total gematrical value of every verse, we get 1 19 786 17 581 12 618 11 241 19 836 18 1072 43 6009. This number is a multiple of 19.

Totals                              139                          10143 
(4) The number shown above includes all parameters of Sura 1 and consists of 38 digits (19x2). 
(5) It is noteworthy that this 38-digit number is still divisible by 19 when we write its components backward, from right to left, as practiced by the Arabs. Thus, 6009 43 1072 18 836 19 241 11 618 12 581 17 786 19 1 is also a multiple of 19. 
(6) The mathematical representations mentioned above participate in numerous extraordinary mathematical phenomena to con ﬁrm all details of the ﬁve daily Contact Prayers (Appendix  15 ).  
(7) Many more astounding phenomena are given in Appendix  One . Thus, the reader is handed, at the outset, tangible proof that this is God's message to the world.

[2:1] A.L.M. 
*2:1 These initials remained a divinely guarded secret for 1400 years. Now we recognize them as a major component of the Quran's extraordinary mathematical code (see Appendices  1 ,  2 ,  24 , and  26 ). The meaning of A.L.M. is pointed out in Verse 2: "This scripture is infallible." This is incontrovertibly proven by the fact that the frequencies of occurrence of these three initials in this sura are 4502, 3202, and 2195, respectively. The sum of these numbers is 9899, or 19x521. Thus, these most frequent letters of the Arabic language are mathematically placed according to a super- human pattern. These same initials also preﬁx Suras  3 ,  29 ,  30 ,  31 , and  32 , and their frequencies of occurrence add up to multiples of 19 in each one of these suras.

[2:3] who believe in the unseen, observe the Contact Prayers (Salat)*, and from our provisions to them, they give to charity. 
*2:3 Since the Contact Prayers are decreed ﬁve times a day, they constitute the prime source of nourishment for our souls. Along with all other practices in Submission, the Contact Prayers were originally revealed through Abraham ( 21:73 ,  22:78 ). Although these ﬁve daily prayers were practiced before the revelation of the Quran, each Contact Prayer is speciﬁcally mentioned in the Quran ( 24:58 ,  11:114 ,  17:78 , &  2:238 ). Appendices  1  &  15  provide physical evidence supporting ALL the details of the Contact Prayers, including the number of units (Rak'aas) and the numbers of bowings, prostrations, and Tashahhuds in each prayer.  
**2:3 When God uses the plural tense, this indicates that other entities, usually the angels, are involved. When God spoke to Moses, the singular 
form was used ( 20:12 -14). See Appendix  10 . 
ﻳ ﻦ ﻳ ﺆ ﻣ ﻨ ﻮ ن ﺑ ﻤ ﺎ أ ﻧ ﺰ ل إ ﻚ و ﻣ ﺎ أ ﻧ ﺰ ل

[2:4]  And they believe in what was revealed to you, and in what was revealed before you, and with regard to the Hereafter, they are absolutely certain.* 
*2:4 Despite severe distortions that af ﬂicted the previous scriptures, God's truth can still be found in them. Both the Old Testament and the New Testament still advocate absolute devotion to God ALONE (Deuteronomy 
6:4-5, Mark  12:29 -30). All distortions are easily detectable.

[2:6] As for those who disbelieve, it is the same for them; whether you warn them, or not warn them, they cannot believe.* 
*2:6-7 Those who make a decision to reject God are helped in that direction; they are prevented by God from seeing any proof or guidance for as long as they maintain such a decision. The consequences of such a 
disastrous decision are spelled out in Verse 7.

It is the Quran's mathematical code, revealed through God's Messenger of the Covenant, Rashad Khalifa, that is the real challenge - for it can never be imitated. See

[2:25] Give good news to those who believe and lead a righteous life that they will have gardens with ﬂowing streams. When provided with a provision of fruits therein, they will say, "This is what was provided for us previously." Thus, they are given allegorical descriptions. They will have 
pure spouses therein, and they abide therein forever.

Two Deaths and Two Lives for the Disbelievers* 
[2:28] How can you disbelieve in  GOD  when you were dead and He gave you life, then He puts you to death, then He brings you back to life, then to Him you ultimately return? 
*2:28 The righteous do not really die; they go straight to Heaven. When their interim on this earth comes to an end, the angels of death simply invite them to go to the same Paradise where Adam and Eve once lived ( 2:154 ,  3:169 ,  8:24 ,  22:58 ,  16:32 ,  36:20 -27,  44:56 ,  89:27 -30). Thus, while the righteous experience only the ﬁrst death following our original sin, the unrighteous go through two deaths ( 40:11 ). At the time of death, the disbelievers know their miserable fate ( 8:50 ,  47:27 ), then they suffer a continuous nightmare that lasts until Hell is created ( 40:46 ,  89:23 ,

Satan: A Temporary "god"*

They said, "Will You place therein one who will spread evil therein and shed blood, while we sing Your praises, glorify You, and uphold Your absolute authority?" He said, "I know what you do not know."

here?" (See Appendix  7 ).

He said, "Do you wish to substitute that which is inferior for that which is good? Go down to Egypt, where you can ﬁnd what you asked for." They have incurred condemnation, humiliation, and disgrace, and brought upon themselves wrath from  GOD . This is because they rejected  GOD 's revelations, and killed the prophets unjustly.

The Heifer* 
[2:67] Moses said to his people, " GOD  commands you to sacriﬁce a heifer." They said, "Are you mocking us?" He said, " GOD   forbid, that I should behave like the ignorant ones." 
*2:67 Although this sura contains important laws and commandments, including the contact prayers, fasting, Hajj pilgrimage, and the laws of marriage, divorce, etc., the name given to the sura is "The Heifer." This reﬂects the crucial importance of submission to God and immediate, unwavering obedience to our Creator. Such submission proves our belief in God's omnipotence and absolute authority. See also the Bible's Book of Numbers, Chapter 19.

Eternity of Heaven and Hell* 
[2:80] Some have said, "Hell will not touch us, except for a limited number of days." Say, "Have you taken such a pledge from  GOD — GOD   never breaks His pledge —or, are you saying about  GOD  what you do not know?" 
*2:80-82 It is an established belief among corrupted Muslims that they will suffer in Hell only in proportion to the number of sins they had committed, then they will get out of Hell and go to Heaven. They also believe that Muhammad will intercede on their behalf, and will take them out of Hell. 
Such beliefs are contrary to the Quran (Appendix  8 ).

What should be the retribution for those among you who do this, except humiliation in this life, and a far worse retribution on

[2:90] Miserable indeed is what they sold their souls for—rejecting these revelations of  GOD  out of sheer resentment that  GOD  should bestow His grace upon whomever He chooses from among His servants. Consequently, they incurred wrath upon wrath. The disbelievers have incurred a

Disregarding God's Scripture 
[2:101]  Now that a messenger from  GOD   has come to them, and even though he proves and con ﬁrms their own scripture, some followers of the scripture (Jews, Christians, and Muslims) disregard  GOD 's scripture behind their backs, as if they never had any scripture.

Witchcraft Condemned 
[2:102]  They pursued what the devils taught concerning Solomon's kingdom. Solomon, however, was not a disbeliever, but the devils were disbelievers. They taught the people sorcery, and that which was sent down through the two angels of Babel, Haroot and Maroot. These two did not divulge such knowledge without pointing out: "This is a test. You shall not abuse such knowledge." But the people used it in such evil schemes as the breaking up of marriages. They can never harm anyone against the will of  GOD . They thus learn what hurts them, not what beneﬁts them, and they know full well that whoever practices witchcraft will have no share in the Hereafter. Miserable indeed is what they sell their souls for, if they only 
knew.

[2:135] They said, "You have to be Jewish or Christian, to be guided." Say, "We follow the religion of Abraham—monotheism —he never was an idol worshiper." 
*2:135 The Quran repeatedly informs us that Submission is the religion of Abraham ( 3:95 ,  4:125 ,  6:161 ,  22:78 ). Abraham received a practical "scripture," namely, all the duties and practices of Submission [the Contact Prayers (Salat), the obligatory charity (Zakat), the fasting of Ramadan, and the Hajj pilgrimage]. Muhammad was a follower of Abraham's religion, as we see in  16:123 ; he delivered this Final Testament, the Quran. The third messenger of Submission    delivered the religion's proof of authenticity 
(see  3:81  and Appendices  1 ,  2 ,  24 , &  26 ).

Abolition of Bigotry and Prejudice* 
[2:142] The fools among the people would say, "Why did they change the direction of their Qiblah?" Say, "To  GOD  belongs the east and the west; He guides whoever wills in a straight path." 
*2:142-145 "Qiblah" is the direction one faces during the Contact Prayers (Salat). When Gabriel conveyed to Muhammad the command to face Jerusalem instead of Mecca, the hypocrites were exposed. The Arabs were strongly prejudiced in favor of the Ka`aba as their "Qiblah." Only the true believers were able to overcome their prejudices; they readily obeyed the 
messenger.

[2:143] We thus made you an impartial community, that you may serve as witnesses among the people, and the messenger serves as a witness among you. We changed the direction of your original Qiblah only to distinguish those among you who readily follow the messenger from those who would turn back on their heels. It was a difﬁcult test, but not for those who are guided by  GOD .  GOD   never puts your worship to waste.  GOD   is Compassionate towards the people, Most Merciful.

[2:144] We have seen you turning your face about the sky (searching for the right direction). We now assign a Qiblah that is pleasing to you. Henceforth, you shall turn your face towards the Sacred Masjid. Wherever you may be, all of you shall turn your faces towards it. Those who received the previous scripture know that this is the truth from their Lord.  GOD  is never unaware

Righteousness De ﬁned 
[2:177] Righteousness is not turning your faces towards the east or the west. Righteous are those who believe in  GOD , the Last Day, the angels, the scripture, and the prophets; and they give the money, cheerfully, to the relatives, the orphans, the needy, the traveling alien, the beggars, and to free the slaves; and they observe the Contact Prayers (Salat) and give the obligatory charity (Zakat); and they keep their word whenever they make a promise; and they steadfastly persevere in the face of persecution, hardship, and war. These are the truthful; these are the righteous.

Discouraging Capital Punishment*

[2:178] O you who believe, equivalence is the law decreed for you when dealing with murder—the free for the free, the slave for the slave, the female for the female. If one is pardoned by the victim's kin, an appreciative response is in order, and an equitable compensation shall be paid. This is an alleviation from your Lord and mercy. Anyone who transgresses beyond this incurs a painful retribution. 
2:178   The Quran clearly discourages capital punishment. Every kind of excuse is provided to spare lives, including the life of the murderer. The victim's kin may ﬁnd it better, under certain circumstances, to spare the life of the murderer in exchange for an equitable compensation. Also capital punishment is not applicable if, for example, a woman kills a man, or vice 
versa.

Fasting Emphasized and Modiﬁed* 
[2:183] O you who believe, fasting is decreed for you, as it was decreed for those before you, that you may attain salvation. 
*2:183-187 Like all duties in Submission, fasting was decreed through Abraham ( 22:78 , Appendices  9   &  15 ). Prior to revelation of the Quran, sexual intercourse was prohibited throughout the fasting period. This rule is modiﬁed in  2:187  to allow intercourse during the nights of Ramadan.

[2:184] Speci ﬁc days (are designated for fasting); if one is ill or traveling, an equal number of other days may be substituted. Those who can fast, but with great dif ﬁculty, may substitute feeding one poor person for each day of breaking the fast. If one volunteers (more righteous works), it is better. But fasting is the best for you, if you only knew.

[2:185]  Ramadan is the month during which the Quran was revealed, providing guidance for the people, clear teachings, and the statute book. Those of you who witness this month shall fast therein. Those who are ill or traveling may substitute the same number of other days.  GOD   wishes for you convenience, not hardship, that you may ful ﬁll your obligations, and to 
glorify  GOD  for guiding you, and to express your appreciation. ﻓ ﺈ ﻗ ﺮ ﺐ أ ﺟﻴﺐ د ﻋﻮ ة ا ع إ ذا د ن ﻓ ﺴﺘ ﺠﻴﺒﻮا و ﺆ ﻣ ﻨﻮ ا ﻟ ﻌ ﻠ ﻬ ﻢ

God Answers the Prayers of "His Servants" 
[2:186] When My servants ask you about Me, I am always near. I answer their prayers when they pray to Me. The people shall respond to Me and believe in Me, in order to be guided.

[2:187] Permitted for you is sexual intercourse with your wives during the nights of fasting. They are the keepers of your secrets, and you are the keepers of their secrets.  GOD  knew that you used to betray your souls, and He has redeemed you, and has pardoned you. Henceforth, you may have intercourse with them, seeking what  GOD  has permitted for you. You may eat and drink until the white thread of light becomes distinguishable from the dark thread of night at dawn. Then, you shall fast until sunset. Sexual intercourse is prohibited if you decide to retreat to the masjid (during the last ten days of Ramadan). These are  GOD 's laws; you shall not transgress them.  GOD   thus clariﬁes His revelations for the people, that they may 
attain salvation.

It is not righteous to beat around the bush; righteousness is attained by upholding the commandments and by being straightforward. You shall observe  GOD , that you may succeed. 
*2:189 The literal Quranic idiom says: "Do not enter the homes through the back doors." The question about the phases of the moon is an example of beating around the bush; there were bad ulterior motives behind this question.

[2:190] You may ﬁght in the cause of  GOD  against those who attack you, but do not aggress.  GOD  does not love the aggressors.

Hajj and `Umrah Pilgrimage*

If you are prevented, you shall send an offering, and do not resume cutting your hair until your offering has reached its destination. If you are ill, or suffering a head injury (and you must cut your hair), you shall expiate by fasting, or giving to charity, or some other form of worship. During the normal Hajj, if you break the state of Ihraam (sanctity) between 'Umrah and Hajj, you shall expiate by offering an animal sacri ﬁce. If you cannot afford it, you shall fast three days during Hajj and seven when you return home— this completes ten—provided you do not live at the Sacred Masjid. You shall observe  GOD , and know that  GOD  is strict in enforcing retribution.

[2:197] Hajj shall be observed in the speciﬁed months*. Whoever sets out to observe Hajj shall refrain from sexual intercourse, misconduct, and arguments throughout Hajj. Whatever good you do,  GOD   is fully aware thereof. As you prepare your provisions for the journey, the best provision is righteousness. You shall observe Me, O you who possess intelligence. 
*2:197 Hajj can be observed any time during the Sacred Months: Zul- Hijjah, Muharram, Safar, and Rabi I. Local governments restrict Hajj to a few days for their own convenience. See  9:37

Disastrous Jealousy 
[2:213] The people used to be one community when  GOD  sent the prophets as bearers of good news, as well as warners. He sent down with them the scripture, bearing the truth, to judge among the people in their disputes. Ironically, those who received the scripture were the ones who rejected any new scripture, despite clear proofs given to them. This is due to jealousy on their part.  GOD  guides those who believe to the truth that is disputed by all others, in accordance with His will.  GOD  guides whoever wills in a straight path.* 
united. truly are religions, all from ALONE, God of worshipers All *2:213 أ ﺣ م ﺣ ﻳ ﺴ ﺘ ﻢ ﻘﻮل ا أ ن ﺗ ﺮﺳﻮل ﺪﺧ ﻠ و ﻮ ﻳﻦ ﻨ ﺔ و ءاﻣ ﻤ ﺎ ﻨﻮا ﻳ ﻣ ﺄﺗ ﻌ ﻪ ﻣ ﻢ ﻣ ﻧ ﺜ ﻞ ﻳ ﻦ أ ﺧ ﻻ ﻠ ﻮ إ ا ن ﻣ ﻧ ﻦ ﻗ ﺒ ﻠ ﻗ ﻢ ﺮ ﺐ ﺴ ﺘ ﻬ ﻢ ﺄ ﺳ ﺎ ء و اء و ز ﺰ ﻮا 
[2:214]  Do you expect to enter Paradise without being tested like those before you? They were tested with hardship and adversity, and were shaken up, until the messenger and those who believed with him said, "Where 
is  GOD 's victory?"  GOD 's victory is near.

However, repelling from the path of  GOD  and disbelieving in Him and in the sanctity of the Sacred Masjid, and evicting its people, are greater sacrileges in the sight of  GOD . Oppression is worse than murder." They will always ﬁght you to revert you from your religion, if they can. Those among you who revert from their religion, and die as disbelievers, have nulliﬁed their works in this life and the Hereafter. These are the dwellers of Hell, wherein they abide forever.

Breaking the Engagement 
[2:236]  You commit no error by divorcing the women before touching them, or before setting the dowry for them. In this case, you shall compensate them —the rich as he can afford and the poor as he can afford — an equitable compensation. This is a duty upon the righteous.

[2:237] If you divorce them before touching them, but after you had set the dowry for them, the compensation shall be half the dowry, unless they voluntarily forfeit their rights, or the party responsible for causing the divorce chooses to forfeit the dowry. To forfeit is closer to righteousness. You shall maintain the amicable relations among you.  GOD   is Seer of everything you do.

[2:238] You shall consistently observe the Contact Prayers, especially the middle prayer, and devote yourselves totally to  GOD . 
*2:238 All ﬁve prayers are found in  2:238 ,  11:114 ,  17:78 , &  24:58 . When the Quran was revealed, the Contact Prayers (Salat) had already been in existence (Appendix  9 ). The details of all ﬁve prayers - what to recite and the number of units (Rak`aas) per prayer, etc. - are mathematically con ﬁrmed. For example, writing down the number of units for each of the ﬁve prayers, next to each other, we get 24434, 19x1286. Also, if we use [*] to represent Sura 1 (Al-Faatehah), where [*]=the sura number (1), followed by the number of verses (7), followed by the number of each verse, the number of letters in each verse, and the gematrical value of every letter, writing down 2[*][*]4[*][*][*][*]4[*][*][*][*]3[*][*][*]4[*][*][*][*]

[2:243] Have you noted those who ﬂed their homes—though they were in the thousands—fearing death?  GOD   said to them, "Die," then revived them.  GOD   showers His grace upon the people, but most people are 
unappreciative.

Saul* 
[2:246] Have you noted the leaders of Israel after Moses? They said to their prophet, "If you appoint a king to lead us, we will ﬁght in the cause of  GOD ." He said, "Is it your intention that, if ﬁghting is decreed for you, you will not ﬁght?" They said, "Why should we not ﬁght in the cause of  GOD , when we have been deprived of our homes, and our children?" Yet, when ﬁghting was decreed for them, they turned away, except a few.  GOD  is aware of the transgressors. 
*2:246 This same history is narrated in the Bible's Book of I Samuel, Ch. 9 
and 10.

[2:247] Their prophet said to them, " GOD  has appointed Taloot (Saul) to be your king." They said, "How can he have kingship over us when we are more worthy of kingship than he; he is not even rich?" He said, " GOD  has chosen him over you, and has blessed him with an abundance in knowledge and in body."  GOD   grants His kingship to whomever He wills.  GOD   is Bounteous, Omniscient.

David and Goliath 
[2:249] When Saul took command of the troops, he said, " GOD  is putting you to the test by means of a stream. Anyone who drinks from it does not belong with me—only those who do not taste it belong with me—unless it is just a single sip." They drank from it, except a few of them. When he crossed it with those who believed, they said, "Now we lack the strength to face Goliath and his troops." Those who were conscious of meeting  GOD  said, "Many a small army defeated a large army by  GOD 's leave.  GOD  is with those who steadfastly persevere."

[2:251]  They defeated them by  GOD 's leave, and David killed Goliath.  GOD  gave him kingship and wisdom, and taught him as He willed. If it were not for  GOD 's support of some people against others, there would be chaos on earth. But  GOD  showers His grace upon the people.

[2:252]  These are  GOD 's revelations. We recite them through you*, truthfully, for you are one of the messengers. 
*2:252 In keeping with the mathematical composition of the Quran, God has willed that the name of the messenger mentioned here shall be spelled out mathematically. The discovery of the Quran's miraculous 19-based code has been divinely reserved for God's Messenger of the Covenant. By adding this verse number (252), plus the gematrical value of "Rashad" (505), plus the gematrical value of "Khalifa" (725) we get 252+505+725 = 1482, or 19x78. Please see Appendices  2  and  26  for the complete details related to the proven identity of God's Messenger of the Covenant, to whom this verse clearly refers.

And we gave Jesus, son of Mary, profound miracles and supported him with the Holy Spirit. Had  GOD   willed, their followers would not have fought with each other, after the clear proofs had come to them. Instead, they disputed among themselves; some of them believed, and some disbelieved. Had  GOD  willed, they would not have fought. Everything is in accordance 
with  GOD 's will.

No Intercession* 
[2:254] O you who believe, you shall give to charity from the provisions we have given to you, before a day comes where there is no trade, no nepotism, and no intercession. The disbelievers are the unjust. 
*2:254 One of Satan's clever tricks is attributing the power of intercession to powerless human idols such as Jesus and Muhammad (Appendix  8 ).

[2:255]  GOD : there is no other god besides Him, the Living, the Eternal. Never a moment of unawareness or slumber overtakes Him. To Him belongs everything in the heavens and everything on earth. Who could intercede with Him, except in accordance with His will? He knows their past, and their future. No one attains any knowledge, except as He wills. His dominion encompasses the heavens and the earth, and ruling them never burdens Him. He is the Most High, the Great.

Abraham's Courageous Debate

stumped.  GOD  does not guide the wicked.

[2:259] Consider the one who passed by a ghost town and wondered, "How can  GOD  revive this after it had died?"  GOD  then put him to death for a hundred years, then resurrected him. He said, "How long have you stayed here?" He said, "I have been here a day, or part of the day." He said, "No! You have been here a hundred years. Yet, look at your food and drink; they did not spoil. Look at your donkey—we thus render you a lesson for the people. Now, note how we construct the bones, then cover them with ﬂesh." When he realized what had happened, he said, "Now I know that  GOD  is Omnipotent." 
*2:259 The lesson we learn here is that the period of death - only the unrighteous die; the righteous go straight to Heaven - passes like one day (see  18:19 -25 and Appendix  17 ).

Usury Prohibited* 
[2:275] Those who charge usury are in the same position as those controlled by the devil's in ﬂuence. This is because they claim that usury is the same as commerce. However,  GOD   permits commerce, and prohibits usury. Thus, whoever heeds this commandment from his Lord, and refrains from usury, he may keep his past earnings, and his judgment rests with  GOD . As for those who persist in usury, they incur Hell, wherein they abide forever. 
*2:275-278 It is an established economic principle that excessive interest on loans can utterly destroy a whole country. During the last few years we have witnessed the devastation of the economies of many nations where excessive interest is charged. Normal interest - less than 20% - where no 
one is victimized and everyone is satis ﬁed, is not usury.

Write Down Financial Transactions 
[2:282] O you who believe, when you transact a loan for any period, you shall write it down. An impartial scribe shall do the writing. No scribe shall refuse to perform this service, according to  GOD 's teachings. He shall write, while the debtor dictates the terms. He shall observe  GOD  his Lord and never cheat. If the debtor is mentally incapable, or helpless, or cannot dictate, his guardian shall dictate equitably. Two men shall serve as witnesses; if not two men, then a man and two women whose testimony is acceptable to all.* Thus, if one woman becomes biased, the other will remind her. It is the obligation of the witnesses to testify when called upon to do so. Do not tire of writing the details, no matter how long, including the time of repayment. This is equitable in the sight of  GOD , assures better witnessing, and eliminates any doubts you may have. Business transactions that you execute on the spot need not be recorded, but have them witnessed. No scribe or witness shall be harmed on account of his services. If you harm them, it would be wickedness on your part. You shall observe  GOD , and  GOD  will teach you.  GOD  is Omniscient. 
*2:282 Financial transactions are the ONLY situations where two women may substitute for one man as witness. This is to guard against the real possibility that one witness may marry the other witness, and thus cause her to be biased. It is a recognized fact that women are more emotionally 
vulnerable than men.

You Shall Not Make Any Distinction 
Among God's Messengers 
[2:285] The messenger has believed in what was sent down to him from his Lord, and so did the believers. They believe in  GOD , His angels, His scripture, and His messengers: "We make no distinction among any of His messengers." They say, "We hear, and we obey.* Forgive us, our Lord. To You is the ultimate destiny." 
* 2:285  One of the major commandments is: "You shall not make any distinction among God's messengers" ( 2:136 ,  3:84 ,  4:150 ). The believers react by saying, "We hear and we obey," while the idol worshipers argue back to justify their insistence upon mentioning Muhammad's name next to God's, to the exclusion of all other messengers. The corrupted Muslims mention Muhammad in their profession of faith (Shahaadah) and during 
their Contact Prayers (see  72:18 ).

Our Lord, and protect us from blaspheming against You, like those before us have done. Our Lord, protect us from sinning until it becomes too late for us to repent. Pardon us and forgive us. You are our Lord and Master. Grant us victory over the disbelieving people."

The Most Important Commandment* 
[3:18]  GOD   bears witness that there is no god except He, and so do the angels and those who possess knowledge. Truthfully and equitably, He is the absolute god; there is no god but He, the Almighty, Most Wise. 
*3:18 The proclamation of faith (Shahaadah) that is decreed by God is: "There is no god except God," in Arabic "La Elaaha Ella Allah" (see also  37:35 ,  47:19 ). The corrupted Muslims insist upon adding a second "Shahaadah" proclaiming that Muhammad is God's messenger. This is by deﬁnition "Shirk" (idolatry) and a ﬂagrant deﬁance of God and His messenger. Additionally, it violates the major commandments in  2:136 ,  2:285 ,  3:84 , &  4:150 -152 prohibiting any distinction among God's messengers. By proclaiming that "Muhammad is a messenger of God," and failing to make the same proclamation for other messengers such as Abraham, Moses, Jesus, Saleh, and Jonah, a distinction is committed and a major commandment is violated.

Submission: The Only Religion 
[3:19]  The only religion approved by  GOD   is "Submission." Ironically, those who have received the scripture are the ones who dispute this fact, despite the knowledge they have received, due to jealousy. For such rejectors of  GOD 's revelations,  GOD  is most strict in reckoning.

[3:20] If they argue with you, then say, "I have simply submitted myself to  GOD ; I and those who follow me." You shall proclaim to those who received the scripture, as well as those who did not, "Would you submit?" If they submit, then they have been guided, but if they turn away, your sole mission is to deliver this message.  GOD  is Seer of all people.

Invitation to All Believers 
[3:64] Say, "O followers of the scripture, let us come to a logical agreement between us and you: that we shall not worship except  GOD ; that we never set up any idols besides Him, nor set up any human beings as lords beside  GOD ." If they turn away, say, "Bear witness that we are submitters."

Be Honest With All People 
[3:75] Some followers of the scripture can be trusted with a whole lot, and they will give it back to you. Others among them cannot be trusted with a single dinar; they will not repay you unless you keep after them. That is

because they say, "We do not have to be honest when dealing with the gentiles!"* Thus, they attribute lies to  GOD , knowingly. 
*3:75 Prior to the discovery of the Quran's mathematical code, some scholars falsely claimed that Muhammad was an illiterate man who could not write such a great book. They distorted the meaning of the word "Ummy," claiming that it meant "illiterate." This verse proves that 
"Ummiyyeen" means "gentiles" (See also  62:2  & Appendix  28 ).

[3:77] As for those who trade away  GOD 's covenant, and their obligations, for a cheap price, they receive no share in the Hereafter.  GOD   will not speak to them, nor look at them, on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them. They have incurred a painful retribution.

Major Prophecy Fulﬁlled* 
God's Messenger of the Covenant 
ا ﺑ و ﻪ ذ ﺸ و أ ﻬ ﺪ ﺧ ﻨ ﻳ ﺬ ﻦ 
[3:81]  GOD  took a covenant from the prophets, saying, "I will give you the scripture and wisdom. Afterwards, a messenger will come to con ﬁrm all existing scriptures. You shall believe in him and support him." He said, "Do you agree with this, and pledge to ful ﬁll this covenant?" They said, "We agree." He said, "You have thus borne witness, and I bear witness along with you." 
*3:81 This major prophecy has now been ful ﬁlled. God's Messenger of the Covenant, as prophesied in this verse and in the Bible's Malachi 3:1-21, Luke 17:22-36 & Matthew 24:27, is to purify and unify God's messages which were delivered by God's prophets. Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, etc. have been severely corrupted. It is the will of Almighty God to purify them and unify them under the banner of worshiping Him alone. Overwhelming evidence has been provided by God in support of His Messenger of the Covenant, whose name is incontrovertibly speciﬁed in the Quran's mathematical code as "Rashad Khalifa." For example, adding the gematrical value of "Rashad" (505), plus the value of "Khalifa" (725), plus the verse number (81) gives 1311, or 
19x69 (see Appendix  2  for the detailed evidence).

The Best Community 
[3:110]  You are the best community ever raised among the people: you advocate righteousness and forbid evil, and you believe in  GOD . If the followers of the scripture believed, it would be better for them. Some of 
them do believe, but the majority of them are wicked.

they will turn around and ﬂee. They can never win.

[3:112] They shall be humiliated whenever you encounter them, unless they uphold  GOD 's covenant, as well as their peace covenants with you. They have incurred wrath from  GOD , and, consequently, they are committed to disgrace. This is because they rejected  GOD 's revelations, and killed the 
prophets unjustly. This is because they disobeyed and transgressed.

[3:153]  Recall that you rushed (after the spoils), paying no attention to anyone, even when the messenger was calling from behind you. Consequently, He substituted one misery for another, that you may not grieve over anything you had missed, or agonize over any hardship you had suffered.  GOD  is Cognizant of everything you do.

Moment of Death Predetermined 
[3:154]  After the setback, He sent down upon you peaceful slumber that paciﬁed some of you. Others among you were selﬁshly concerned about themselves. They harbored thoughts about  GOD   that were not right—the same thoughts they had harbored during the days of ignorance. Thus, they said, "Is anything up to us?" Say, "Everything is up to  GOD ." They concealed inside themselves what they did not reveal to you. They said, "If it was up to us, none of us would have been killed in this battle." Say, "Had you stayed in your homes, those destined to be killed would have crawled into their death beds."  GOD  thus puts you to the test to bring out your true convictions, and to test what is in your hearts.  GOD  is fully aware of the innermost thoughts.

If No Will Is Left* 
[4:11]  GOD   decrees a will for the bene ﬁt of your children; the male gets twice the share of the female.* If the inheritors are only women, more than two, they get two-thirds of what is bequeathed. If only one daughter is left, she gets one-half. The parents of the deceased get one-sixth of the inheritance each, if the deceased has left any children. If he left no children, and his parents are the only inheritors, the mother gets one-third. If he has siblings, then the mother gets one-sixth. All this, after ful ﬁlling any will* the deceased has left, and after paying off all debts. When it comes to your parents and your children, you do not know which of them is really the best to you and the most bene ﬁcial. This is  GOD 's law.  GOD   is Omniscient, Most Wise. 
*4:11 Generally, the son is responsible for a family, while the daughter is taken care of by a husband. However, the Quran recommends in  2:180  that a will shall be left to conform with the speciﬁc circumstances of the

Inheritance For the Spouses 
[4:12]  You get half of what your wives leave behind, if they had no children. If they had children, you get one-fourth of what they leave. All this, after fulﬁlling any will they had left, and after paying off all debts. They get one-fourth of what you leave behind, if you had no children. If you had children, they get one-eighth of what you bequeath. All this, after fulﬁlling any will you had left, and after paying off all debts. If the deceased man or woman was a loner, and leaves two siblings, male or female, each of them gets one-sixth of the inheritance. If there are more siblings, then they equally share one-third of the inheritance. All this, after fulﬁlling any will, and after paying off all debts, so that no one is hurt. This is a will decreed

Health Quarantine 
[4:15] Those who commit adultery among your women, you must have four witnesses against them, from among you. If they do bear witness, then you shall keep such women in their homes until they die, or until  GOD  creates an exit for them.* 
*4:15 A woman witnessed by four people in the act of committing adultery on four different occasions, with four different partners, represents a danger to public health. Such a woman is a depository of germs, and a health quarantine protects the society from her. A good example of an exit that saves a quarantined woman is marriage - someone may wish to marry her, 
and thus protect her and the society.

Mutual Attraction And Dowry Required 
[4:24] Also prohibited are the women who are already married, unless they ﬂee their disbelieving husbands who are at war with you.* These are  GOD 's commandments to you. All other categories are permitted for you in marriage, so long as you pay them their due dowries. You shall maintain your morality, by not committing adultery. Thus, whoever you like among them, you shall pay them the dowry decreed for them. You commit no error by mutually agreeing to any adjustments to the dowry.  GOD  is Omniscient, Most Wise. 
*4:24 If believing women ﬂee their disbelieving husbands who are at war with the believers, they do not have to obtain a divorce before remarriage. See  60:10 .

[4:25] Those among you who cannot afford to marry free believing women, may marry believing slave women.  GOD  knows best about your belief, and you are equal to one another, as far as belief is concerned. You shall obtain permission from their guardians before you marry them, and pay them their due dowry equitably. They shall maintain moral behavior, by not committing adultery, or having secret lovers. Once they are freed through marriage, if they commit adultery, their punishment shall be half of that for the free women.* Marrying a slave shall be a last resort for those unable to wait. To be patient is better for you.  GOD  is Forgiver, Most Merciful. 
*4:25 This law proves that the punishment for adultery could not possibly be stoning to death as stated in the laws of corrupted Muslims (see  24:2 ).

Do Not Beat Your Wife* 
[4:34]  The men are made responsible for the women,** and  GOD   has endowed them with certain qualities, and made them the bread earners. The righteous women will cheerfully accept this arrangement, since it is  GOD 's commandment, and honor their husbands during their absence. If you experience rebellion from the women, you shall ﬁrst talk to them, then (you may use negative incentives like) deserting them in bed, then you may (as a last alternative) beat them. If they obey you, you are not permitted to transgress against them.  GOD  is Most High, Supreme. 
*4:34 God prohibits wife-beating by using the best psychological approach. For example, if I don't want you to shop at Market X, I will ask you to shop at Market Y, then at Market Z, then, as a last resort, at Market X. This will effectively stop you from shopping at Market X, without insulting you. Similarly, God provides alternatives to wife-beating; reasoning with her ﬁrst, then employing certain negative incentives. Remember that the theme of this sura is defending the women's rights and countering the prevalent oppression of women. Any interpretation of the verses of this sura must be in favor of the women. This sura's theme is "protection of women."  
**4:34 This expression simply means that God is appointing the husband as "captain of the ship." Marriage is like a ship, and the captain runs it after due consultation with his of ﬁcers. A believing wife readily accepts God's appointment, without mutiny.

[4:36] You shall worship  GOD  alone—do not associate anything with Him. You shall regard the parents, the relatives, the orphans, the poor, the related neighbor, the unrelated neighbor, the close associate, the traveling alien, and 
your servants.  GOD  does not like the arrogant show-offs.

Had they said, "We hear, and we obey," and "We hear you," and "Unzurna (watch over us)," it would have been better for them, and more righteous. Instead, they have incurred condemnation from  GOD  due to their disbelief. Consequently, the majority of them cannot believe.

Believers  Or  Hypocrites? 
[4:60]  Have you noted those who claim that they believe in what was revealed to you, and in what was revealed before you, then uphold the unjust laws of their idols? They were commanded to reject such laws. 
Indeed, it is the devil's wish to lead them far astray.

[4:64] We did not send any messenger except to be obeyed in accordance with  GOD 's will. Had they, when they wronged their souls, come to you and prayed to  GOD   for forgiveness, and the messenger prayed for their forgiveness, they would have found  GOD  Redeemer, Most Merciful.

[4:77] Have you noted those who were told, "You do not have to ﬁght; all you need to do is observe the Contact Prayers (Salat) and give the obligatory charity (Zakat)," then, when ﬁghting was decreed for them, they feared the people as much as they feared  GOD , or even more? They said, "Our Lord, why did You force this ﬁghting on us? If only You respite us for awhile!" Say, "The materials of this world are nil, while the Hereafter is far better for the righteous, and you never suffer the slightest injustice."

God is the Doer of Everything* 
[4:78] Wherever you are, death will catch up with you, even if you live in formidable castles. When something good happens to them, they say, "This is from  GOD ," and when something bad afﬂicts them, they blame you. Say, "Everything comes from  GOD ." Why do these people misunderstand almost everything? 
*4:78 Bad things are consequences of our own deeds ( 42:30 ,  64:11 ), though God is the doer of everything ( 8:17 ). God created the ﬁre to serve us, but you can decide to put your ﬁnger in it. We thus hurt ourselves. It is God's law that if you put your ﬁnger in the ﬁre, it will hurt.

Nothing Bad Comes From God 
[4:79] Anything good that happens to you is from  GOD , and anything bad that happens to you is from you. We have sent you as a messenger to the people,* and  GOD  suf ﬁces as witness. 
*4:79 Muhammad was not given any proof of prophethood. Hence the expression "God sufﬁces as a witness" ( 29:51 -52). The gematrical value of 
"Muhammad" is 92, and 92+79=171=19x9.

the devil, except a few.

How to Deal With the Hypocrites 
[4:88]  Why should you divide yourselves into two groups regarding the hypocrites (among you)?  GOD  is the one who condemned them because of their own behavior. Do you want to guide those who are sent astray by  GOD ? Whomever  GOD  sends astray, you can never ﬁnd a way to guide

[4:89]  They wish that you disbelieve as they have disbelieved, then you become equal. Do not consider them friends, unless they mobilize along with you in the cause of  GOD . If they turn against you, you shall ﬁght them, and you may kill them when you encounter them in war. You shall not accept them as friends, or allies.*

Had  GOD   willed, He could have permitted them to ﬁght against you. Therefore, if they leave you alone, refrain from ﬁghting you, and offer you peace, then  GOD  gives you no excuse to ﬁght them.

You Shall Not Kill 
[4:92] No believer shall kill another believer, unless it is an accident. If one kills a believer by accident, he shall atone by freeing a believing slave, and paying a compensation to the victim's family, unless they forfeit such a compensation as a charity. If the victim belonged to people who are at war with you, though he was a believer, you shall atone by freeing a believing slave. If he belonged to people with whom you have signed a peace treaty, you shall pay the compensation in addition to freeing a believing slave. If you cannot ﬁnd* a slave to free, you shall atone by fasting two consecutive months, in order to be redeemed by  GOD .  GOD  is Knower, Most Wise. 
*4:92 Since slavery does not exist, the offender must atone by fasting two 
consecutive months.

them stand behind you as you prostrate. Then, let the other group that has not prayed take their turn praying with you, while the others stand guard and hold their weapons. Those who disbelieved wish to see you neglect your weapons and your equipment, in order to attack you once and for all. You commit no error, if you are hampered by rain or injury, by putting down your weapons, so long as you remain alert.  GOD  has prepared for the

The Contact Prayers 
[4:103]  Once you complete your Contact Prayer (Salat), you shall remember  GOD   while standing, sitting, or lying down.* Once the war is over, you shall observe the Contact Prayers (Salat); the Contact Prayers (Salat) are decreed for the believers at speci ﬁc times. 
*4:103 Your god is whoever or whatever occupies your mind most of the day. In order to belong in God's kingdom, and enjoy His grace and protection, the Quran exhorts us to remember God "always" ( 2:152   & 200,  3:191 ,  33:41 -42). This profound fact explains the numerous verses asserting that "most" of those who believe in God are going to Hell ( 12:106 ,  23:84 -89,  29:61 -63,  31:25 ,  39:38 ,  43:87 ).

Lessons From Israel 
[4:153] The people of the scripture challenge you to bring down to them a book from the sky! They have asked Moses for more than that, saying, "Show us  GOD , physically." Consequently, the lightning struck them, as a consequence of their audacity. Additionally, they worshiped the calf, after all the miracles they had seen. Yet, we pardoned all this. We supported 
Moses with profound miracles.

All factions who are disputing in this matter are full of doubt concerning this issue. They possess no knowledge; they only conjecture. For certain, they never killed him.* 
*4:157-158 Jesus, the real person, the soul, was raised in the same manner as in the death of any righteous person. Subsequently, his enemies arrested, tortured, and cruciﬁed his living, but empty, body.

[4:176]  They consult you; say, " GOD   advises you concerning the single person. If one dies and leaves no children, and he had a sister, she gets half the inheritance. If she dies ﬁrst, he inherits from her, if she left no children. If there were two sisters, they get two-thirds of the inheritance. If the siblings are men and women, the male gets twice the share of the female."  GOD  thus clari ﬁes for you, lest you go astray.  GOD  is fully aware of all things.

Only Four Meats Prohibited 
"Animals that die of themselves" De ﬁned 
[5:3] Prohibited for you are animals that die of themselves, blood, the meat of pigs,* and animals dedicated to other than  GOD . (Animals that die of themselves include those) strangled, struck with an object, fallen from a height, gored, attacked by a wild animal—unless you save your animal before it dies—and animals sacriﬁced on altars. Also prohibited is dividing the meat through a game of chance; this is an abomination. Today, the disbelievers have given up concerning (the eradication of) your religion; do not fear them and fear Me instead. Today, I have completed your religion, perfected My blessing upon you, and I have decreed Submission as the religion for you. If one is forced by famine (to eat prohibited food), without being deliberately sinful, then  GOD  is Forgiver, Merciful. 
*5:3 The "meat" of the pig is prohibited, not the "fat." Anything that is not speciﬁcally prohibited in the Quran must be considered lawful. See  6:145 -

[5:12]  GOD   had taken a covenant from the Children of Israel, and we raised among them twelve patriarchs. And  GOD   said, "I am with you, so long as you observe the Contact Prayers (Salat), give the obligatory charity (Zakat), and believe in My messengers and respect them, and continue to lend  GOD   a loan of righteousness. I will then remit your sins, and admit you into gardens with ﬂowing streams. Anyone who disbelieves after this, has indeed strayed off the right path." 
*5:12 If you ful ﬁll the requirements stated in this verse, God will let you know that He is with you; you will have no doubt about it. Prominent among God's signs are mathematical signs for those who understand the Quran's miracle (Appendix  One ).

*5:19 This verse reports the ful ﬁllment of the biblical and Quranic prophecy regarding the advent of God's Messenger of the Covenant (Malachi 3:1, Quran  3:81 ). The name of this messenger is mathematically coded into the Quran as "Rashad Khalifa." This very special verse warrants the presentation of speciﬁc evidence. By adding the gematrical value of "Rashad" (505), plus the value of "Khalifa" (725), plus the sura number (5), plus the verse number (19), we obtain a total of 505+725+5+19 = 1254, or 19x66. Nineteen is the Quran's common denominator, which was revealed through Rashad Khalifa. More evidence and speci ﬁc details are in

The First Murder* 
[5:27] Recite for them the true history of Adam's two sons. They made an offering, and it was accepted from one of them, but not from the other. He said, "I will surely kill you." He said, " GOD   accepts only from the righteous. 
*5:27-31 The names of the two sons involved in this ﬁrst murder are not 
relevant. But they are given in the Bible as Abel and Cain (Genesis 4:2-9).

[5:32] Because of this, we decreed for the Children of Israel that anyone who murders any person who had not committed murder or horrendous crimes, it shall be as if he murdered all the people. And anyone who spares a life, it shall be as if he spared the lives of all the people. Our messengers went to them with clear proofs and revelations, but most of them, after all 
this, are still transgressing.

Capital Punishment: When is it Justi ﬁed? 
[5:33] The just retribution for those who ﬁght  GOD  and His messenger, and commit horrendous crimes, is to be killed, or cruci ﬁed, or to have their hands and feet cut off on alternate sides, or to be banished from the land. This is to humiliate them in this life, then they suffer a far worse retribution 
in the Hereafter.

Mathematical Proof Supports Quranic Justice 
[5:38]  The thief, male or female, you shall mark their hands* as a punishment for their crime, and to serve as an example from  GOD .  GOD  is Almighty, Most Wise. 
*5:38 The practice of cutting off the thief's hand, as decreed by the false Muslims, is a satanic practice without Quranic basis. Due to the special importance of this example, God has provided mathematical proof in support of marking the hand of the thief, rather than severing it. Verse  12:31   refers to the women who so admired Joseph that they "cut" their hands. Obviously, they did not "cut off" their hands; nobody can. The sum of sura and verse numbers are the same for  5:38  and  12:31 , i.e., 43. It is also the will and mercy of God that this mathematical relationship conforms with the Quran's 19-based code. Nineteen verses after  12:31 , we 
see the same word ( 12:50 ).

Among the Jews, some listened to lies.

Whomever  GOD   wills to divert, you can do nothing to help him against  GOD .  GOD does not wish to cleanse their hearts.

You shall rule among them in accordance with  GOD 's revelations, and do not follow their wishes if they differ from the truth that came to you. For each of you, we have decreed laws and different rites. Had  GOD   willed, He could have made you one congregation. But He thus puts you to the test through the revelations He has given each of you. You shall compete in righteousness.

Blaspheming Against God 
[5:64] The Jews even said, " GOD 's hand is tied down!" It is their hands that are tied down. They are condemned for uttering such a blasphemy. Instead, His hands are wide open, spending as He wills. For certain, your Lord's revelations to you will cause many of them to plunge deeper into transgression and disbelief. Consequently, we have committed them to animosity and hatred among themselves until the Day of Resurrection. Whenever they ignite the ﬂames of war,  GOD   puts them out. They roam the earth wickedly, and  GOD  dislikes the evildoers.

Today's Christianity Not Jesus' Religion* 
[5:72] Pagans indeed are those who say that  GOD   is the Messiah, son of Mary. The Messiah himself said, "O Children of Israel, you shall worship  GOD ; my Lord and your Lord." Anyone who sets up any idol beside  GOD ,  GOD  has forbidden Paradise for him, and his destiny is Hell. The wicked have no helpers. 
*5:72-76 In John 20:17, we see that Jesus taught that he was neither God, nor the son of God. Many theologians have concluded, after careful research, that today's Christianity is not the same Christianity taught by Jesus. Two outstanding books on this subject are "The Myth of God Incarnate" (The Westminster Press, Philadelphia, 1977) and The "Mythmaker" (Harper & Row, New York, 1986). On the front jacket of "The Mythmaker" we read the following statement: "...Hyam Maccoby presents new arguments to support the view that Paul, not Jesus, was the founder of Christianity....it was Paul alone who created a new religion through his vision of Jesus as a divine Savior who died to save humanity."

**6:38 All information relevant to our eternal life of the Hereafter is contained in the Quran. The true believers accept, without hesitation, God's assertion: "We did not leave anything out of this book." The importance of this statement, and similar statements, is reﬂected in the fact that each of them consists of 19 Arabic letters (Appendix  19 ).

*6:124 Jealousy and ego are human traits that provoke some people to question God's wisdom in selecting His messengers. Corrupted Muslim scholars have uttered this same utterance regarding the revelation of the Quran's mathematical code through God's Messenger of the Covenant.

[6:125] Whomever  GOD  wills to guide, He renders his chest wide open to Submission. And whomever He wills to send astray, He renders his chest intolerant and straitened, like one who climbs towards the sky.*  GOD  thus places a curse upon those who refuse to believe. 
*6:125 Centuries after the revelation of the Quran, we learned that the proportion of oxygen diminishes as we climb towards the sky, and we gasp for air.

Abusing God's Provisions 
[6:136]  They even set aside a share of  GOD 's provisions of crops and livestock, saying, "This share belongs to  GOD ," according to their claims, "and this share belongs to our idols." However, what was set aside for their idols never reached  GOD , while the share they set aside for  GOD  invariably went to their idols. Miserable indeed is their judgment.

[6:137] Thus were the idol worshipers duped by their idols, to the extent of killing their own children.* In fact, their idols in ﬂict great pain upon them, and confuse their religion for them. Had  GOD  willed, they would not have done it. You shall disregard them and their fabrications. 
*6:137 A perfect example is the internationally infamous incident of the execution of a Saudi Arabian princess in 1978 for alleged adultery. God's law institutes whipping, not execution, as a punishment for adultery ( 24:1 - 2), while the idolatrous laws stipulate execution. As pointed out in  42:21 , 
the traditionalists follow a religion that is not authorized by God.

requite them for their innovations. He is Most Wise, Omniscient. 
ﻗ ﺪ ﺧ ﻣ ﻬ ﺘ ﺪ ﻳ ﻦ 
[6:140] Losers indeed are those who killed their children foolishly, due to their lack of knowledge, and prohibited what  GOD  has provided for them, and followed innovations attributed to  GOD . They have gone astray; they 
are not guided.

Zakat Must Be Given "On The Day Of Harvest"* 
[6:141] He is the One who established gardens, trellised and untrellised, and palm trees, and crops with different tastes, and olives, and pomegranate— fruits that are similar, yet dissimilar. Eat from their fruits, and give the due alms on the day of harvest,* and do not waste anything. He does not love the wasters. 
*6:141 Zakat charity is so important, the Most Merciful has restricted His mercy to those who give it ( 7:156 ). Yet, the corrupted Muslims have lost this most important commandment; they give Zakat only once a year. We see here that Zakat must be given away "on the day we receive income." The proportion that came to us through Abraham is 2.5% of our net income.

*6:145-146 Only four kinds of animal products are prohibited: animals that die of themselves, running blood (not trapped within the meat), the meat of pigs, and animals dedicated to other than their Creator. Verse 146 informs us that such prohibitions are very speci ﬁc; God prohibits either "the meat" or "the fat," or both, if He so wills.

[6:146]  For those who are Jewish we prohibited animals with undivided hoofs; and of the cattle and sheep we prohibited the fat, except that which is carried on their backs, or in the viscera, or mixed with bones. That was a retribution for their transgressions, and we are truthful.

*6:149 The Quran's mathematical code is a tangible and utterly incontrovertible proof that this is God's message to the world. It takes divine intervention to prevent any reader from appreciating this extraordinary phenomenon, then falling prostrate, and accepting this overwhelming miracle (see  17:45 -46,  18:57 ,  56:79 , and Appendix  One ).

[6:150]  Say, "Bring your witnesses who would testify that  GOD   has prohibited this or that." If they testify, do not testify with them. Nor shall you follow the opinions of those who reject our revelations, and those who disbelieve in the Hereafter, and those who stray away from their Lord.

You shall not kill your children from fear of poverty—we provide for you and for them. You shall not commit gross sins, obvious or hidden. You shall not kill — GOD  has made life sacred—except in the course of justice. These

*6:157 The role of the Quran's mathematical code is evident from the fact that the sum of the verse number (157) plus the gematrical value of "Rashad Khalifa" (1230), through whom the code was revealed, gives 1387, 
or 19x73.

[7:54] Your Lord is the one  GOD , who created the heavens and the earth in six days,* then assumed all authority. The night overtakes the day, as it pursues it persistently, and the sun, the moon, and the stars are committed to serve by His command. Absolutely, He controls all creation and all commands. Most Exalted is  GOD , Lord of the universe. 
*7:54 The six days of creation are allegorical; they serve as a yardstick to let us know the relative complexity of our in ﬁnitesimal planet Earth - it was created in "4 days" (see  41:10 ).

Miracles in Sinai 
[7:160] We divided them into twelve tribal communities, and we inspired Moses when his people asked him for water: "Strike the rock with your staff," whereupon twelve springs gushed out therefrom. Thus, each community knew its water. And we shaded them with clouds, and sent down to them manna and quails: "Eat from the good things we provided for you." It is not us that they wronged; it is they who wronged their own souls.

Rebellion Despite the Miracles 
[7:161]  Recall that they were told, "Go into this town to live, and eat therefrom as you please, treat the people amicably, and enter the gate humbly. We will then forgive your transgressions. We will multiply the 
reward for the righteous."

Observing the Commandments

[7:163]  Remind them of the community by the sea, who desecrated the Sabbath. When they observed the Sabbath, the ﬁsh came to them abundantly. And when they violated the Sabbath, the ﬁsh did not come. We 
thus afﬂicted them, as a consequence of their transgression.

"Apologize to your Lord," that they might be saved. ﻳ ﻦ ﻳ ﻨﻬ ﻮ ن ﻋ ﻦ ا ﺴ ﻮ ء و أ ﺧ ﺬﻧ ﻳ ﻦ ﻇ ﻠ ﻤ ﻮ ا ﺑ ﻌ ﺬ ا ب ﺑ ـ ﺲ ﺑ ﻤ ﺎ ﻧ ﻮ ا

[7:167] Additionally, your Lord has decreed that He will raise up against them people who will inﬂict severe persecution upon them, until the Day of Resurrection. Your Lord is most efﬁcient in enforcing retribution, and He is

[7:169] Subsequent to them, He substituted new generations who inherited the scripture. But they opted for the worldly life instead, saying, "We will be forgiven." But then they continued to opt for the materials of this world. Did they not make a covenant to uphold the scripture, and not to say about  GOD   except the truth? Did they not study the scripture? Certainly, the abode of the Hereafter is far better for those who maintain 
righteousness. Do you not understand?

We Are Born With Instinctive Knowledge About God* 
[7:172] Recall that your Lord summoned all the descendants of Adam, and had them bear witness for themselves: "Am I not your Lord?" They all said, "Yes. We bear witness." Thus, you cannot say on the Day of Resurrection, "We were not aware of this."

*8:17 Believing in God necessitates believing in His qualities, one of which is that He is doing everything. Without knowing God, there is no belief ( 23:84 -90). Bad things are incurred by us, and executed by Satan, in

Sura 9: Ultimatum (Bara'ah) - ة ءا 
ﻳ ﻦ ﻋ ﻬ ﺪ ﺗ ﻢ ﻣ ﻦ ا ﻤ

و ر 
ﺑ ﺮ ا ء ة ﻣ ﻦ 
No Basmalah* 
[9:1] An ultimatum is herein issued from  GOD   and His messenger to the idol worshipers who enter into a treaty with you. 
*9:1 The absence of Basmalah from this sura is not only a profound sign from the Almighty Author of the Quran that this sura has been tampered with, but also represents an awsome miracle in its own right. See the details in Appendices  24  &  29 . 
*9:1 & *9:127 This is the only sura that is not pre ﬁxed with the Basmalah. This phenomenon has puzzled the students of the Quran for 14 centuries, and many theories were advanced to explain it. Now we realize that the conspicuous absence of the Basmalah serves three purposes: (1) It represents an advance divine proclamation that the idol worshipers were destined to tamper with the Quran by adding 2 false verses (9:128-129). (2) It demonstrates one of the functions of God's mathematical code in the Quran, namely, to guard the Quran against any alteration. (3) It provides additional miraculous features of the Quran's code. Due to their extraordinary importance, the details are given in Appendices  24   and  29 . One immediate observation is that the number of occurrences of the word "God" at the end of Sura 9 is 1273 (19x67).  If the two false verses 128 & 129 are included, this phenomenon - and many more - will vanish. 
ﻓ ﺴﻴﺤﻮ اﻷ رض أ ﻌ ﺔ أ ﺷﻬ ﺮ و اﻋﻠ ﻤﻮ ﻧ ﻢ ﻏ ﻣ ﻌﺠ ﺰ و أ ن ﺰ ﻔ ﺮ ﻦ 
[9:2] Therefore, roam the earth freely for four months, and know that you cannot escape from  GOD , and that  GOD  humiliates the disbelievers.

Important Criterion* 
[9:24]  Proclaim: "If your parents, your children, your siblings, your spouses, your family, the money you have earned, a business you worry about, and the homes you cherish are more beloved to you than  GOD  and His messenger, ** and the striving in His cause, then just wait until  GOD  brings His judgment."  GOD  does not guide the wicked people. 
*9:24 Since the odds are overwhelming against any human being to actually believe and devote the worship to God alone ( 12:103 , 106), it is virtually impossible to see a whole family believe. Thus, most believers have been faced with the choice: "Either me or God and His messenger." This choice is consistently stated by spouses of the believers, or their parents, their children, etc. Consistently, the believers made the right choice. This is a mandatory test for all believers ( 29:2 ).  
**9:24 The Quranic, mathematical evidence points speciﬁcally at God's Messenger of the Covenant. By adding the gematrical value of "Rashad" (505), plus the value of "Khalifa" (725), plus the verse number (24), we get

Upholding the Teachings of Religious Leaders, 
Instead of God's Teachings 
[9:31]  They have set up their religious leaders and scholars as lords,* instead of  GOD . Others dei ﬁed the Messiah, son of Mary. They were all commanded to worship only one god. There is no god except He. Be He glori ﬁed, high above having any partners. 
*9:31 If you consult the "Muslim scholars" about worshiping God alone, and upholding the word of God alone, as taught in this proven scripture, they will advise you against it. If you consult the Pope about the identity of Jesus, he will advise you to uphold a trinity. If you obey the "Muslim scholars" whose advice is contrary to God's teachings, or if you take the Pope's advice instead of God's, you have set up these religious leaders as 
gods instead of God.

This conﬁrms that the messenger here is Rashad Khalifa.

The gematrical value of  9:33   &  61:9 , calculated by adding the values of every letter, is 7858. By adding this number, plus the number of letters in the two verses (120), plus the number of verses from  9:33  to  61:9 (3902), plus the value of "Rashad Khalifa" (1230), we get 7858+120+3902+1230=13110=19x690.

Altering the Sacred Months* 
[9:37]  Altering the Sacred Months is a sign of excessive disbelief; it augments the straying of those who have disbelieved. They alternate the Sacred Months and the regular months, while preserving the number of months consecrated by  GOD . They thus violate what  GOD   has consecrated. Their evil works are adorned in their eyes.  GOD   does not guide the disbelieving people. 
*9:37 The Sacred Months according to the corrupted Muslim World are Rajab, Zul-Qe`dah, Zul-Hijjah, and Muharram (7th, 11th, 12th and 1st months of the Islamic Calendar). A careful study of the Quran, however, reveals that they should be Zul-Hijjah, Muharram, Safar, and Rabi I (12th, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd months). See Appendix  15 .

He made the word of the disbelievers lowly.  GOD 's word reigns supreme.  GOD  is Almighty, Most Wise.

The Contact Prayer Existed Before Muhammad* 
[9:54]  What prevented the acceptance of their spending is that they disbelieved in  GOD   and His messenger, and when they observed the Contact Prayers (Salat),* they observed them lazily, and when they gave to charity, they did so grudgingly. 
*9:54 This is another proof that the Contact Prayers (Salat) existed before the Quran, and were handed down from Abraham (see  21:73 ). Also, it stumps those who challenge God's assertion that the Quran is complete and fully detailed when they ask, "Where can we ﬁnd the details of the Contact Prayers in the Quran?" ( 6:19 , 38, 114).

The Myth of Intercession* 
[9:80] Whether you ask forgiveness for them, or do not ask forgiveness for them—even if you ask forgiveness for them seventy times— GOD  will not forgive them. This is because they disbelieve in  GOD   and His messenger.  GOD  does not guide the wicked people. 
*9:80 If Muhammad could not intercede on behalf of his own uncles and cousins, what makes strangers who never met him think that he will intercede on their behalf? Abraham could not intercede on behalf of his father, nor could Noah intercede on behalf of his son ( 11:46  &  60:4 ).

[9:94] They apologize to you when you return to them (from battle). Say, "Do not apologize; we no longer trust you.  GOD   has informed us about you."  GOD  will see your works, and so will the messenger, then you will be returned to the Knower of all secrets and declarations, then He will

*9:107 Any masjid where the practices are not devoted absolutely to God ALONE belongs to Satan, not God. For example, mentioning the names of Abraham, Muhammad, and/or Ali in the Azan and/or the Salat prayers violates God's commandments in  2:136 ,  2:285 ,  3:84 , &  72:18 .

The Hypocrites 
[9:124] When a sura was revealed, some of them would say, "Did this sura strengthen the faith of anyone among you?" Indeed, it did strengthen the 
faith of those who believed, and they rejoice in any revelation.

unholiness to their unholiness, and they died as disbelievers.

A Historical Crime Unveiled: Tampering With the 
Word of God.*  
God Provides Irrefutable Evidence 
[9:127] Whenever a sura was revealed, some of them would look at each other as if to say: "Does anyone see you?" Then they left. Thus,  GOD  has diverted their hearts, for they are people who do not comprehend.

*9:1 & *9:127 This is the only sura that is not pre ﬁxed with the Basmalah. This phenomenon has puzzled the students of the Quran for 14 centuries, and many theories were advanced to explain it. Now we realize that the conspicuous absence of the Basmalah serves three purposes: (1) It represents an advance divine proclamation that the idol worshipers were destined to tamper with the Quran by adding 2 false verses (9:128-129). (2) It demonstrates one of the functions of God's mathematical code in the Quran, namely, to guard the Quran against any alteration. (3) It provides additional miraculous features of the Quran's code. Due to their extraordinary importance, the details are given in Appendices  24   and  29 . One immediate observation is that the number of occurrences of the word "God" at the end of Sura 9 is 1273 (19x67).  If the two false verses 128 & 129 are included, this phenomenon - and many more - will vanish.

*10:20 In retrospect, we see now that the Quran's miracle, indeed "One of the greatest miracles" ( 74:30 -35), was divinely predestined to be unveiled 14 centuries after Muhammad. In view of the current condition of the traditional Muslims, if Muhammad had been given this miracle, those Muslims, who are already idolizing Muhammad beside God, would have worshiped him as God incarnate. Additionally, this miracle is obviously designed for the computer age, and to be appreciated by mathematically 
sophisticated generations.

[10:22] He is the One who moves you across the land and sea. You get onto the ships, and they sail smoothly in a nice breeze. Then, while rejoicing therein, violent wind blows, and the waves surround them from every side. This is when they implore  GOD , sincerely devoting their prayers to Him alone: "If You only save us this time, we will be eternally appreciative."

[10:23] But as soon as He saves them, they transgress on earth, and oppose the truth. O people, your transgression is only to the detriment of your own souls. You remain preoccupied with this worldly life, then to us is your ultimate return, then we inform you of everything you had done.

[10:24] The analogy of this worldly life is like this: we send down water from the sky to produce with it all kinds of plants from the earth, and to provide food for the people and the animals. Then, just as the earth is perfectly adorned, and its people think that they are in control thereof, our judgment comes by night or by day,* leaving it completely barren, as if nothing existed the previous day. We thus explain the revelations for people who re ﬂect. 
*10:24 God, of course, knows whether His judgment will come during the day, or during the night. But it just happens that the earth will be half day and half night when the end of the world comes. Another "scienti ﬁc miracle" of the Quran.

Only God Can Author the Quran 
[10:37] This Quran could not possibly be authored by other than  GOD . It conﬁrms all previous messages, and provides a fully detailed scripture. It is 
infallible, for it comes from the Lord of the universe.

*11:1 Our generation is fortunate to witness two awesome phenomena in the Quran: (1) an extraordinary mathematical code (Appendix  1 ), and (2) a literary miracle of incredible dimensions. If humans attempt to write a mathematically structured work, the numerical manipulations will adversely affect the literary quality. The Quran sets the standard for literary

[11:7] He is the One who created the heavens and the earth in six days —* and His (earthly) domain was completely covered with water —** in order to test you, to distinguish those among you who work righteousness. Yet, when you say, "You will be resurrected after death," those who disbelieve would say, "This is clearly witchcraft." 
*11:7 The six days are simply a yardstick providing us with a lot of information. Thus, we learn that the vast lifeless physical universe was created in two days, while the tiny mote called "Earth" was created in four days ( 41:10 -12). The provision of food, water, and oxygen for the earth's inhabitants had to be precisely calculated and arranged.  
**11:7 The earth was initially covered with water. Subsequently, the land mass emerged, and the continents drifted apart.

*12:31 This is the same word used in  5:38  regarding the hand of the thief, and the sum of sura and verse numbers (12+31 and 5+38) are the same. Therefore, the thief's hand should be marked, not severed as practiced by the corrupted Islam (see Footnote  5:38 ).

[12:42] He then said to the one to be saved "Remember me at your lord."* Thus, the devil caused him to forget his Lord, and, consequently, he remained in prison a few more years. 
*12:42 When Joseph begged his companion to intercede with the king on his behalf, he exhibited dependence on other than God to be saved from the prison. This does not be ﬁt a true believer, and such a serious slip cost Joseph a few years in the prison. We learn from the Quran that only God can relieve any hardship that might befall us. A true believer trusts in God and depends totally on Him alone ( 1:5 ,  6:17 ,  8:17 ,  10:107 ).

The shadows are predetermined by God's design of the solar and the lunar orbits, and by the peculiar shape of the planet earth which causes the four seasons.

God's Messenger of the Covenant* 
[13:30] We have sent you (O Rashad)* to this community, just as we did for other communities in the past. You shall recite to them what we reveal to you, for they have disbelieved in the Most Gracious. Say, "He is my Lord. There is no god except He. I put my trust in Him alone; to Him is my ultimate destiny." 
*13:30 If we add the gematrical value of "Rashad" (505), plus the value of "Khalifa" (725), plus the sura number (13), plus the verse number (30), we get 505+725+13+30 = 1273 = 19x67. God thus speciﬁes the name of His 
messenger (see Appendix  2  for the details).

*14:17 When we rebelled against God, and agreed with Satan during the great feud ( 38:69 ), the angels suggested that we should be banished to Hell (Appendix  7 ). But the Most Merciful decided to give us another chance to redeem ourselves. He said to the angels, "I know what you do not know" ( 2:30 ). God knew that many humans would have protested that they had no idea how bad Hell was. The awesome description of Hell in  14:17   and in  22:19 -22 nulliﬁes such a protest. Now we have a pretty good idea how terrible Hell is.

[14:20] This is not too difﬁcult for  GOD . 
On the Day of Resurrection 
[14:21]  When they all stand before  GOD ,* the followers will say to the leaders, "We used to follow you. Can you spare us even a little bit of  GOD 's retribution?" They will say, "Had  GOD  guided us, we would have guided you. Now it is too late, whether we grieve or resort to patience, there is no exit for us." 
*14:21 Frequently, the Quran talks about the Hereafter in the past tense. This is because those are future events already witnessed by God, and will surely come to pass.

Satan Disowns His Followers 
[14:22]  And the devil will say, after the judgment had been issued, " GOD   has promised you the truthful promise, and I promised you, but I broke my promise. I had no power over you; I simply invited you, and you accepted my invitation. Therefore, do not blame me, and blame only yourselves. My complaining cannot help you, nor can your complaining help me. I have disbelieved in your idolizing me. The transgressors have

*16:30-32 The righteous taste only the ﬁrst death, which has been already experienced by all of us (see  44:56 ). At the end of their interim in this world, the angels of death simply invite them to move on to the Paradise where Adam and Eve once lived ( 2:154 ,  3:169 ,  8:24 ,  22:58 ,  36:26 -27).

The Bee 
[16:68]  And your Lord inspired the bee: build homes in mountains and 
trees, and in (the hives) they build for you. 
ﻚ ذ ﻼ 
[16:69]  Then eat from all the fruits, following the design of your Lord, precisely. From their bellies comes a drink of different colors, wherein there is healing for the people. This should be (suf ﬁcient) proof for people who re ﬂect.* 
*16:69 Besides its recognized nutritive value, honey has been scientiﬁcally 
proven as a healing medicine for certain allergies and other ailments. ﺧ ﻠ ﻘ ﻢ ﺘ ﻮ ﻓ ﯩ ﻢ و ﻣ ﻟ ﻻ ﻳ ﻌﻠ ﻢ ﺑ ﻌ ﺪ ﻋ ﻠ ﻢ ﺷ ﻴ ـ ﺎ إ ن ﻋ ﻠﻴﻢ

[16:70]  GOD  created you, then He terminates your lives. He lets some of you live to the oldest age, only to ﬁnd out that there is a limit to the

No Partners With God

[16:71]  GOD  has provided for some of you more than others. Those who are given plenty would never give their properties to their subordinates to the extent of making them partners. Would they give up  GOD 's blessings?* 
*16:71 If the humans would not give up their power to that extent, why do they expect God to do this, and create partners for Himself?

[16:72]  And  GOD   made for you spouses from among yourselves, and produced for you from your spouses children and grandchildren, and provided you with good provisions. Should they believe in falsehood, and turn unappreciative of  GOD 's blessings?

The Rich Believer is Better than the Poor Believer 
[16:75]  GOD   cites the example of a slave who is owned, and is totally powerless, compared to one whom we blessed with good provisions, from which he gives to charity secretly and publicly. Are they equal? Praise be 
to  GOD , most of them do not know.

Lip Service Does Not Count 
[16:106]  Those who disbelieve in  GOD , after having acquired faith, and become fully content with disbelief, have incurred wrath from  GOD . The only ones to be excused are those who are forced to profess disbelief, while their hearts are full of faith.* 
*16:106 God's wisdom decrees that if someone holds a gun to your head and orders you to declare that you disbelieve in God, you may grant him his 
wish. What the heart harbors is what counts.

Prohibiting Lawful Food Brings Deprivation 
[16:112]  GOD  cites the example of a community that used to be secure and prosperous, with provisions coming to it from everywhere. But then, it turned unappreciative of  GOD 's blessings. Consequently,  GOD   caused them to taste the hardships of starvation and insecurity. Such is the requital 
for what they did.

They were ﬂeeing the persecution of neo-Christians who proclaimed a corrupted Christianity three centuries after Jesus, following the Nicene Conferences, when the Trinity doctrine was announced.

Connection With the End of the World* 
[18:21] We caused them to be discovered, to let everyone know that  GOD 's promise is true, and to remove all doubt concerning the end of the world.* The people then disputed among themselves regarding them. Some said, "Let us build a building around them." Their Lord is the best knower about them. Those who prevailed said, "We will build a place of worship around them." 
*18:21 As detailed in Appendix  25 , this story helped pinpoint the end of the world. 
ﺒ ﻬ ﻢ 
[18:22]  Some would say, "They were three; their dog being the fourth," while others would say, "Five; the sixth being their dog," as they guessed. Others said, "Seven," and the eighth was their dog. Say, "My Lord is the best knower of their number." Only a few knew the correct number. Therefore, do not argue with them; just go along with them. You need not consult anyone about this.

The divine assertion that every `new' proof is opposed has been proven by the Arabs' opposition to the Quran's miracle. (App.  1  &  2 ).

*21:51 Was Abraham so smart as to discover God, or, did God grant him the intelligence because He knew that he deserved to be saved? As it turns out, this whole world was created to redeem those among us who deserve redemption. When the angels suggested that all the rebels, humans and jinns, must be banished out of God's kingdom, He said, `I know what you do not know' ( 2:30 ). At the same time, this world proves Satan's incompetence 
as a god (App.  7 ).

The End of the World* 
[21:96] Not until Gog and Magog reappear, will they then return —they will come from every direction. 
*21:96 By the year 2270 AD, thanks to God's mathematical miracle in the Quran (Appendix  1 ), America will be the heart of Islam, and billions around the globe will have believed in the Quran ( 9:33 ,  41:53 ,  48:28 ,  61:9 ). Gog and Magog (allegorical names of villainous communities), will be the only bastions of heathenism, and they will attack the submitters. That is when the world will end ( 15:87 ,  18:94 , Appendix  25 ). Gog and Magog are mentioned in  18:94  &  21:96 , 17 verses before the end of each sura; this may indicate the time of their appearance.

Where Did We Come From? 
[22:5] O people, if you have any doubt about resurrection, (remember that) we created you from dust, and subsequently from a tiny drop, which turns into a hanging (embryo), then it becomes a fetus that is given life or deemed lifeless. We thus clarify things for you. We settle in the wombs whatever we will for a predetermined period.* We then bring you out as infants, then you reach maturity. While some of you die young, others live to the worst age, only to ﬁnd out that no more knowledge can be attained beyond a certain limit. Also, you look at a land that is dead, then as soon as we shower it with water, it vibrates with life and grows all kinds of beautiful plants. 
*22:5 The Quran's mathematical miracle is based on the number 19. As it turns out, this number represents the Creator's signature on His creations. Thus, you and I have 209 bones in our bodies (209=19x11). The length of pregnancy for a full term fetus is 266 days (19x14) (Langman's Medical 
Embryology, T. W. Sadler, Page 88, 1985).

The System* 
[22:52] We did not send before you any messenger, nor a prophet, without having the devil interfere in his wishes.  GOD  then nulliﬁes what the devil has done.  GOD  perfects His revelations.  GOD  is Omniscient, Most Wise.* 
*22:52 Throughout this worldly test, Satan is allowed to present his point of view (we are born with a representative of Satan in our bodies). This allows the people to make a choice between God's evidence and Satan's evidence. Satan's evidence is invariably based on lies. This system explains the fact that the devil's agents continuously come up with the most absurd lies, insults and accusations against every messenger (see  6:33 -34,  8:30 ,  17:76 - 77,  27:70 ).

*22:78 Although all messengers preached one and the same message, "Worship God alone," Abraham was the ﬁrst messenger to coin the terms "Submission" (Islam) and "Submitter" (Muslim) ( 2:128 ). What did Abraham contribute to Submission? We learn from  16:123  that all religious duties in Submission were revealed through Abraham (see Appendices  9  &  26 ).

How to Deal With Rumors and Unproven Accusations 
[24:11] A gang among you produced a big lie.* Do not think that it was bad for you; instead, it was good for you. Meanwhile, each one of them has earned his share of the guilt. As for the one who initiated the whole incident, he has incurred a terrible retribution. 
*24:11 This refers to a historical incident where the Prophet's wife Aysha was left in the desert by mistake, and later found by a young man who helped her catch up with the Prophet's caravan. This triggered the famous 
`Big Lie' against Aysha.

They shall not strike their feet when they walk in order to shake and reveal certain details of their bodies. All of you shall repent to  GOD , O you believers, that you may succeed.* 
*24:30-31 Dressing modestly, therefore, is a trait of the believing men and women. The minimum requirements for a woman's dress is to lengthen her garment ( 33:59 ) and to cover her chest. Tyrannical Arab traditions have given a false impression that women must be covered from head to toe; 
Such is not a Quranic or Islamic dress.

Encourage Marriage to Discourage Immorality 
[24:32]  You shall encourage those of you who are single to get married. They may marry the righteous among your male and female servants, if they are poor.  GOD  will enrich them from His grace.  GOD  is Bounteous, Knower.

And give them from  GOD 's money that He has bestowed upon you. You shall not force your girls to commit prostitution, seeking the materials of this world, if they wish to be chaste. If anyone forces them, then  GOD , seeing that they are forced, is Forgiver, 
Merciful.

God 
[24:35]  GOD  is the light of the heavens and the earth. The allegory of His light is that of a concave mirror behind a lamp that is placed inside a glass container. The glass container is like a bright, pearl-like star. The fuel thereof is supplied from a blessed oil-producing tree, that is neither eastern, nor western. Its oil is almost self-radiating; needs no ﬁre to ignite it. Light upon light.  GOD   guides to His light whoever wills (to be guided).  GOD  thus cites the parables for the people.  GOD  is fully aware of 
all things.

Chasing A Mirage 
[24:39] As for those who disbelieve, their works are like a mirage in the desert. A thirsty person thinks that it is water. But when he reaches it, he ﬁnds that it is nothing, and he ﬁnds  GOD  there instead, to requite him fully 
for his works.  GOD  is the most ef ﬁcient reckoner.

Exile From God: Total Darkness 
[24:40] Another allegory is that of being in total darkness in the midst of a violent ocean, with waves upon waves, in addition to thick fog. Darkness upon darkness—if he looked at his own hand, he could barely see it. 
Whomever  GOD deprives of light, will have no light. ا ﺴ ﻤ ﻮ ت و ا ﻷ رض و ا ﻟ ﻄ ﺻ ﻔﺖ ﻗ ﺪ ﻋ ﻠ ﻢ ﺻ ﻼﺗ ﻪ و ﺴ ﻴ ﺤ ﻪ و ﻋ ﻠ ﻴ ﻢ

[24:58] O you who believe, permission must be requested by your servants and the children who have not attained puberty (before entering your rooms). This is to be done in three instances —before the Dawn Prayer, at noon when you change your clothes to rest, and after the Night Prayer. These are three private times for you. At other times, it is not wrong for you or them to mingle with one another.  GOD  thus clariﬁes the revelations for

[24:62]  The true believers are those who believe in  GOD   and His messenger,* and when they are with him in a community meeting, they do not leave him without permission. Those who ask permission are the ones who do believe in  GOD  and His messenger. If they ask your permission, in order to tend to some of their affairs, you may grant permission to whomever you wish, and ask  GOD  to forgive them.  GOD  is Forgiver, Most Merciful. 
*24:62 This verse refers to God's Messenger of the Covenant; by adding the gematrical value of "Rashad" (505) plus the value of "Khalifa" (725), plus the verse number (62), we get 1292, a multiple of 19 (1292=19x68). See Appendix  2 .

[24:63]  Do not treat the messenger's requests as you treat each others' requests.  GOD   is fully aware of those among you who sneak away using ﬂimsy excuses. Let them beware—those who disobey his orders—for a 
disaster may strike them, or a severe retribution.

Similarly, God has launched us into space - on board spaceship Earth - and He has designed all kinds of renewable provisions for us and other creatures, a perfect design. Think, for example, of the symbiotic relationship between us and the plants; we use the oxygen they produce in photosynthesis, while they use the carbon dioxide we produce in 
respiration.

*28:43 The Torah is the collection of all the scriptures revealed to all the prophets of Israel, including the book of Moses. The Quran consistently states that Moses was given a book, or "the Statute Book." Nowhere in the Quran do we see that Moses was given "the Torah." Today's Old Testament, 
therefore, is the Torah (see  3:50 ,  5:46 ).

Addressing God's Messenger of the Covenant 
[28:44] You were not present on the slope of the western mount, when we issued the command to Moses; you were not a witness.* 
*28:44 The name of this messenger is conﬁrmed mathematically: by placing the gematrical value of "Rashad Khalifa" (1230) next to the verse 
number (44), we get 123044=19x6476.

The Torah and The Quran 
[28:48] Now that the truth has come to them from us, they said, "If only we could be given what was given to Moses!" Did they not disbelieve in what was given to Moses in the past? They said, "Both (scriptures) are works of magic that copied one another." They also said, "We are disbelievers in both 
of them."

[29:10] Among the people there are those who say, "We believe in  GOD ," but as soon as they suffer any hardship because of  GOD , they equate the people's persecution with  GOD 's retribution. But if blessings from your Lord come your way, they say, "We were with you." Is  GOD   not fully aware of the people's innermost thoughts?

*29:14 Since the Quran's miracle is mathematical, the numbers especially constitute an important part of the 19-based code. Thus, the numbers mentioned in the Quran add up to 162146, or 19x8534 (see Appendix  1  for

reverence Him. This is better for you, if you only knew.

[29:17] "What you worship instead of  GOD  are powerless idols; you have invented a lie." 
God: The Only Source of Provisions 
The idols you worship beside  GOD  do not possess any provisions for you. Therefore, you shall seek provisions only from  GOD . You shall worship 
Him alone, and be appreciative of Him; to Him is your ultimate return.

[29:19] Have they not seen how  GOD  initiates the creation, then repeats it?

*29:19-20 We learn from the Quran that evolution is a divinely guided process. See Appendix  31  for the details.

[29:43] We cite these examples for the people, and none appreciate them except the knowledgeable.* 
*29:41-43 It takes a knowledgeable person to know that the Black Widow spider kills her mate. The use of the feminine reference to the spider in  29:41  is thus signi ﬁcant. This is in addition to the fact that the spider web

[30:40]  GOD  is the One who created you. He is the One who provides for you. He is the One who puts you to death. He is the One who resurrects you. Can any of your idols do any of these things? Be He glori ﬁed. He is 
much too exalted to have any partners. ﺎ س ﺬ ﻳ ﻘ ﻬ ﻢ ﺑ ﻌﺾ ى ﻋ ﻤ ﻠ ﻮ ا ﻟ ﻌ ﻠ ﻬ ﻢ ﻳ ﺮﺟ ﻌ ﻮ ن

[33:21] The messenger of  GOD  has set up a good example for those among you who seek  GOD  and the Last Day, and constantly think about  GOD . 
*33:21 Satan took this verse out of context, and relied on the people's idolization of the prophet Muhammad to innovate a whole set of unauthorized and unreasonable regulations called "Sunna of the Prophet." This created a totally different religion (see  42:21  and Appendix  18 ).

*33:40 Despite this clear de ﬁnition of Muhammad, most Muslims insist that he was the last prophet and also the last messenger. This is a tragic human trait as we see in  40:34 . Those who readily believe God realize that God sends His purifying and consolidating Messenger of the Covenant  after the 
ﬁnal prophet Muhammad ( 3:81 ,  33:7 ).

Etiquette 
[33:53] O you who believe, do not enter the prophet's homes unless you are given permission to eat, nor shall you force such an invitation in any manner. If you are invited, you may enter. When you ﬁnish eating, you shall leave; do not engage him in lengthy conversations. This used to hurt the prophet, and he was too shy to tell you. But  GOD  does not shy away from the truth. If you have to ask his wives for something, ask them from behind a barrier. This is purer for your hearts and their hearts. You are not to hurt the messenger of  GOD . You shall not marry his wives after him, for this would be a gross offense in the sight of  GOD .* 
*33:53 We are enjoined in  4:22  from marrying women who were previously married to our fathers. Nor can the father marry the divorced wife of his son ( 4:23 ). This divine commandment preserves our respect for our fathers and their most private affairs. Similarly, the prophet was a father ﬁgure to the believers of his time. For the good of those believers, God enjoined them from marrying women who were previously married to the prophet. Marriage is a sacred and very private relationship, and the prophet's 
private life was better kept private.

The Objective: Do We Believe in the Hereafter?* 
[34:21] He never had any power over them. But we thus distinguish those who believe in the Hereafter from those who are doubtful about it.* Your Lord is in full control of all things. 
*34:21 The criteria that inform us whether or not we believe in the Hereafter are in  6:113 ,  17:45 , &  39:45 . These three criteria bring out our 
true convictions, regardless of our oral statements.

*34:28 As detailed in Appendix  2 , the name of this messenger is mathematically coded into the Quran as "Rashad Khalifa." By adding the numerical value of the name "Rashad" (505), plus the numerical value of the name "Khalifa" (725), plus the number of the sura (34), plus the number of the verse (28), we obtain a total that conforms with the Quran's 19-based mathematical miracle, which was unveiled through Rashad Khalifa.

God is in Full Control 
[35:11]  GOD  created you from dust, then from a tiny drop, then He causes you to reproduce through your spouses. No female becomes pregnant, nor gives birth, without His knowledge. No one survives for a long life, and no one's life is snapped short, except in accordance with a pre-existing record. 
This is easy for  GOD .

Appreciating God's Greatness* 
[35:12] The two seas are not the same; one is fresh and delicious, while the other is salty and undrinkable. From each of them you eat tender meat, and extract jewelry to wear. And you see the ships sailing through them, seeking His provisions, that you may be appreciative. 
*35:12-13 When we send our astronauts into space, we provide them with their minimum needs of food, water, and oxygen. When we sided with Satan's blasphemy billions of years ago (Appendix  7 ), God launched us into space aboard the spaceship Earth. But God has supplied our spaceship with awesome renewable systems that provide a great variety of fresh foods, 
water, oxygen, and even the reproduction of us astronauts. 
[35:13] He merges the night into the day, and merges the day into the night. He has committed the sun and the moon to run for a predetermined period of time. Such is  GOD   your Lord; to Him belongs all kingship. Any idols you set up beside Him do not possess as much as a seed's shell.

[35:14] If you call on them, they cannot hear you. Even if they hear you, they cannot respond to you. On the Day of Resurrection, they will disown you. None can inform you like the Most Cognizant.

they were powerless.

The only people to heed your warnings are those who reverence their Lord, even when alone in their privacy, and observe the Contact Prayers (Salat). Whoever puriﬁes his soul, 
does so for his own good. To  GOD  is the ﬁnal destiny.

*39:5 This verse clearly informs us that the earth is round. The Arabic for "He rolls" (Yukawwir) is derived from the Arabic word for "ball" (Kurah). Since the Earth is not exactly round, a speciﬁc reference to its shape is given in  79:30 . The Quran is replete with scientiﬁc information that became known to us centuries after the revelation of the Quran. See Appendix  20 .

*39:45 Despite the clear commandment in  3:18   that the First Pillar of Islam is proclaiming: "Ash-hadu An Laa Elaaha Ellaa Allah (there is no other god beside God)," the majority of "Muslims" insist upon adding the name of Muhammad. This Greatest Criterion alerts us that rejoicing in adding the name of Muhammad, or any other name, exposes disbelief in the Hereafter. See also Footnote  17:46 .

*39:67 Our universe, with its billion galaxies, a billion trillion stars, uncountable decillions of heavenly bodies, spanning many billions of light- years, is the smallest and innermost of seven universes. This incomprehensible vastness of the seven universes is within God's hand.

The Day of Judgment 
[39:68] The horn will be blown, whereupon everyone in the heavens and the earth will be struck unconscious, except those who will be spared by  GOD . Then it will be blown another time, whereupon they will all rise up, looking.* 
*39:68 The sequence of events on the Day of Resurrection begins with the symbolic blowing of the horn. The second blowing of the horn - by a creature who was spared from unconsciousness - marks the resurrection of all people; they will be resurrected on today's earth. This earth will then be destroyed by the physical coming of God, then a new earth and new heavens will be created ( 14:48 ). We will then be stratiﬁed according to our

Who is the Last Messenger?* 
A Tragic Human Trait 
[40:34] Joseph had come to you before that with clear revelations, but you continued to doubt his message. Then, when he died you said, " GOD  will not send any other messenger after him. (He was the last messenger)!"**  GOD   thus sends astray those who are transgressors, doubtful. 
*40:34 The Jews refused to believe in the Messiah when he came to them, the Christians refused to believe in Muhammad when he came to them, and a majority of today's Muslims believe that Muhammad was the last messenger. On that erroneous basis, they refused to accept God's Messenger of the Covenant. We learn from  3:81 -90 and  33:7  that those who fail to accept the Quranic injunction to "believe in and support God's Messenger of the Covenant" are no longer believers. See Appendices  2  &  26 .  
**40:34 It is noteworthy that we ﬁnd the name "Rashad" in the Arabic text precisely four verses ahead of the injunction against saying "the last 
messenger," and also four verses after it.

*40:78 We learn from  17:45 -46,  18:57 , and  56:79  that the unbelievers have no access to the Quran; only the believers and the sincere seekers are permitted by God to understand it. The Quran's mathematical code, "One of the great miracles" ( 74:30 -35), was authorized by God, and revealed 
through His Messenger of the Covenant (Appendix  2 ).

immediately recognized (Apps. 1 & 24).

[41:43]  What is said to you is precisely what was said to the previous messengers. Your Lord possesses forgiveness, and He also possesses painful retribution. 
*41:43 Mathematical proof shows that this verse refers to God's Messenger of the Covenant. By adding the gematrical value of "Rashad" (505), plus the value of "Khalifa" (725), plus this verse number (43), we get 505+725+43=1273=19x67. See Appendix  2 .

*42:21 The Islam of today's Muslim world has been so distorted, it has become a Satanic cult. The Ulama, or religious scholars, have added many extraneous laws, prohibitions, dress codes, dietary regulations, and religious practices never authorized by God. This is one of the main reasons for sending God's Messenger of the Covenant ( 9:31 ,  33:67 , and Appendix  33 ).

*42:24 The disbelievers added 2 false statements at the end of Sura 9 to commemorate their idol, the prophet Muhammad. God has revealed overwhelming evidence to erase this blasphemy and establish the truth.

Jesus and the End of the World* 
[43:61] He is to serve as a marker for knowing the end of the world,* so you can no longer harbor any doubt about it. You shall follow Me; this is the right path. 
*43:61 As detailed in Appendix  25 , the End of the World is given in the Quran, and the birthdate of Jesus provided one of the signiﬁcant signs that the calculations are correct. We learn that the world will end in the year 2280 (19x120) after the birth of Jesus (see  47:18 ). Additionally, both the lunar year (1710) & the solar year (2280) are divisible by 570 (19x30), the number of years from the birth of Jesus to the birth of Muhammad. Thus, the birthdate of Jesus is a marker.

40: The Age of Decision* 
[46:15] We enjoined the human being to honor his parents. His mother bore him arduously, gave birth to him arduously, and took intimate care of him for thirty months. When he reaches maturity, and reaches the age of forty,* he should say, "My Lord, direct me to appreciate the blessings You have bestowed upon me and upon my parents, and to do the righteous works that please You. Let my children be righteous as well. I have repented to You; I am a submitter." 
*46:15 God knows full well who deserves to go to Heaven and who deserves to go to Hell. It is His law that whomever He puts to death before the age of 40 shall go to Heaven. God's immense mercy is reﬂected in the fact that most people have difﬁculty accepting this divine mercy; they 
argue: "Put them in Hell!" See Appendix  32 .

End of the World* 
[47:18] Are they waiting until the Hour comes to them suddenly? All the signs thereof have already come.* Once the Hour comes to them, how will they beneﬁt from their message? 
*47:18 The Quran, being the Final Testament, provides all the signs needed to pinpoint the end of the world; AD 2280. See Appendix  25  for the details.

First Commandment 
[47:19] You shall know that: "There is no other god beside  GOD ,"* and ask forgiveness of your sins and the sins of all believing men and women.  GOD  is fully aware of your decisions and your ultimate destiny. 
*47:19 Signi ﬁcantly, the "First Pillar" of religion is stated in the sura entitled Muhammad, and is utterly devoted to God alone. Muhammad's name was added by his idolizers, against his will.

Exposing the Hypocrites 
[47:20] Those who believed said: "When will a new sura be revealed?" But when a straightforward sura was revealed, wherein ﬁghting was mentioned, you would see those who harbored doubts in their hearts looking at you, as if death had already come to them. They were thus exposed.

Warning to the Arabs* 
If you turn away, He will substitute other people in your place, and they will not be like you. 
*47:38 The Quran was given to the Arabs, in their language, for 1400 years, but they clearly rejected  it and refused to believe that  it is complete; they fabricated Hadith and Sunna.

It is our generation that witnessed the revelations of God's great miracle in the Quran (Appendix  1 ).

You Shall Support God's Messenger 
[48:10] Surely, those who pledge allegiance to you, are pledging allegiance to  GOD .  GOD   approves their pledge; He places His hand above their hands. Those who violate such a pledge, commit the violation to their own detriment. As for those who fulﬁll their pledge with  GOD , He will grant

The Great Prophecy* 
[48:28] He is the One who sent His messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth, to make it prevail over all other religions.  GOD  sufﬁces as a witness. 
*48:28 This important prophecy informs us that Submission will inevitably dominate the whole world. This, together with Verses  9:33 ,  41:53 , and  61:9 leave no doubt that God's mathematical miracle of the Quran will play a major role in this prophecy. Solid Quranic mathematical evidence points to God's Messenger of the Covenant as fulﬁlling this prophecy. See Appendices  2  and  26  for the evidence and speciﬁc details.

[48:29]  Muhammad —the messenger of  GOD —and those with him are harsh and stern against the disbelievers, but kind and compassionate amongst themselves. You see them bowing and prostrating, as they seek  GOD 's blessings and approval. Their marks are on their faces, because of prostrating. This is the same example as in the Torah. Their example in the Gospel is like plants that grow taller and stronger, and please the farmers. He thus enrages the disbelievers.  GOD   promises those among them who believe, and lead a righteous life, forgiveness and a great recompense.

Preoccupation With This Life Condemned

It is like abundant rain that produces plants and pleases the disbelievers. But then the plants turn into useless hay, and are blown away by the wind. In the Hereafter there is either severe retribution, or forgiveness from  GOD   and approval. This worldly life is no more than a temporary illusion.

God Defends the Believers 
[59:2] He is the One who evicted those who disbelieved among the people of the scripture from their homes in a mass exodus. You never thought that they would leave, and they thought that their preparations would protect them from  GOD . But then  GOD   came to them whence they never expected, and threw terror into their hearts. Thus, they abandoned their homes on their own volition, in addition to pressure from the believers. You 
should learn from this, O you who possess vision.

You shall give it to the relatives, the orphans, the poor, and the traveling alien. Thus, it will not remain monopolized by the strong among you. You may keep the spoils given to you by the messenger, but do not take what he enjoins you from taking. You shall reverence  GOD .  GOD   is strict in

Abraham: An Example 
[60:4] A good example has been set for you by Abraham and those with him. They said to their people, "We disown you and the idols that you worship besides  GOD . We denounce you, and you will see nothing from us except animosity and hatred until you believe in  GOD   ALONE."* However, a mistake was committed by Abraham when he said to his father, "I will pray for your forgiveness,** but I possess no power to protect you from  GOD ." "Our Lord, we trust in You, and submit to You; to You is the ﬁnal destiny. 
*60:4 The Arabic word for "ALONE" (WAHDAHU) occurs only six times in the Quran, one of them refers to upholding the Quran ALONE ( 17:46 ). The reference to God ALONE occurs in  7:70 ,  39:45 ,  40:12  & 84, and  60:4 . The sum of these numbers (7+70+39+45+40+ 12+84+60+4) equals 361, or 19x19. This emphasizes that the main theme of the Quran is "Worship God ALONE." See Appendix  1 .  
**60:4 We can pray for guidance for the idolators, not forgiveness, since 
God's law is that idolatry is the only unforgivable offense ( 4:48  & 116).

[60:8]  GOD  does not enjoin you from befriending those who do not ﬁght you because of religion, and do not evict you from your homes. You may befriend them and be equitable towards them.  GOD  loves the equitable.

[60:9]  GOD  enjoins you only from befriending those who ﬁght you because of religion, evict you from your homes, and band together with others to banish you. You shall not befriend them. Those who befriend them are the transgressors.

In Case of War 
[60:10]  O you who believe, when believing women (abandon the enemy and) ask for asylum with you, you shall test them.  GOD  is fully aware of their belief. Once you establish that they are believers, you shall not return them to the disbelievers. They are not lawful to remain married to them, nor shall the disbelievers be allowed to marry them. Give back the dowries that the disbelievers have paid. You commit no error by marrying them, so long as you pay them their due dowries. Do not keep disbelieving wives (if they wish to join the enemy). You may ask them for the dowry you had paid, and they may ask for what they paid. This is  GOD 's rule; He rules among 
you.  GOD  is Omniscient, Most Wise.

[60:11] If any of your wives join the enemies' camp, and you are forced to ﬁght, you shall force the enemy to compensate the men who lost their wives, by giving them what they spent on their wives. You shall reverence  GOD , in whom you believe.

*63:1 The " ﬁrst pillar of Islam," as stated in  3:18   is to bear witness that God is the only god. But the corrupted "Muslim" scholars add "Muhammad is God's messenger," and this violates a number of commandments (see  2:285 ). Verse  63:1   is the only place in the Quran where such a 
statement is made. Only the hypocrites make such a statement.

[65:1]  O you prophet, when you people divorce the women, you shall ensure that a divorce interim is ful ﬁlled. You shall measure such an interim precisely.* You shall reverence  GOD   your Lord. Do not evict them from their homes, nor shall you make life miserable for them, to force them to leave on their own, unless they commit a proven adultery. These are  GOD 's laws. Anyone who transgresses  GOD 's laws commits an injustice against himself. You never know; maybe  GOD  wills something good to come out of this. 
*65:1 The divorcee's interim, before becoming eligible for remarriage, is a waiting period of three menstruations. This ensures that the divorcee was not pregnant ( 2:228 ). 
ﻓ ﺈ ذا ﺑ ذ ﻟ ﻠ ﻐﻦ أ ﺟ ﻠ ﻬ ﻦ ﻆ ﻓ ﺑ ﺄ ﻪ ﻣ ﺴ ﻦ ﻜﻮﻫ ن ﻦ ﻳ ﺑ ﺆ ﻤ ﻣ ﻦ ﻌﺮو ﺑ ف أ و و ﻓﺎر ﻮ م ﻗﻮﻫ ﻦ الءا ﺑ ﻤ ﺧ ﺮ ﻌﺮو و ﻣ ف و أ ﺘﻖ ﺷﻬ ﺪوا ذ و ﻌ ى ﻋ ﺪل ﺮ ﻣ ﺟ ﺎ ﻢ و أ ﻗﻴﻤ ﻮا ا ﺸﻬ ﺪ ة 
[65:2] Once the interim is ful ﬁlled, you may reconcile with them equitably, or go through with the separation equitably. You shall have two equitable witnesses witness the divorce before  GOD . This is to enlighten those who believe in  GOD  and the Last Day. Anyone who reverences  GOD , He will create an exit for him.

*72:10-28 The messenger here is named, mathematically, as "Rashad Khalifa," to whom God  revealed the end of the world (Appendix  25 ). The number of verses from  1:1  to  72:27 , where  the messenger is mentioned, is 5472, 19x72x4. The word "Rashada" occurs 4 times in Sura 72.  The value of "Rashada" is 504, and 504 + 28 (verses of Sura 72) is 532, 19x28. The value of  "Rashad Khalifa" (1230) + 72 + 28 = 1330 = 19x70. The digits of Sura 72 and its number of verses  (28) add up to 7 + 2 + 2 + 8 = 19. Also, the crucial expression, "only to a messenger that He  chooses" has a value 
of 1919, 19x101.

He knows that some of you may be ill, others may be traveling in pursuit of  GOD 's provisions, and others may be striving in the cause of  GOD . You shall read what you can of it, and observe the contact prayers (Salat), give the obligatory charity (Zakat), and lend  GOD  a loan of righteousness. Whatever good you send ahead on behalf of your souls, you will ﬁnd it at  GOD   far better and generously rewarded. And implore  GOD  for forgiveness.  GOD  is Forgiver, Most Merciful.

*Thus, the total occurrence of the crucial word "God" (Allah) throughout the Quran is 2698, 19x142. The reader can ascertain the accuracy of this total by randomly checking the numbers of the word "God" at the bottom of any pages in this book. Additionally, if one adds the verse numbers wherever the word "God" occurs, the total comes to 118123, also a multiple of 19 (118123 = 19x6217). Details of the Quran's unique mathematical composition are given in Appendices  1 ,  2 ,  24 ,  25 ,  26 , and  29 .

Appendix 1 
One of the Great Miracles [ 74:35 ] 
Simple to Understand Impossible to Imitate 
For the ﬁrst time in history we have a scripture with built-in proof of divine authorship - a superhuman mathematical composition. 
Any reader of this book can easily verify the Quran ’s mathematical miracle. The word "God" (Allah) is written in bold capital letters throughout the text. The cumulative frequency of occurrence of the word "God" is noted at the bottom of each page in the left hand corner. The number in the right hand corner is the cumulative total of the numbers for verses containing the word "God." The last page of the text, Page 372, shows that the total occurrence of the word "God" is 2698, or 19×142. The total sum of verse numbers for all verses containing the word "God" is 118123, also a multiple of 19 (118123 = 19×6217). 
Nineteen is the common denominator throughout the Quran ’s mathematical system. 
This phenomenon alone sufﬁces as incontrovertible proof that the Quran is God ’s message to the world. No human being(s) could have kept track of 2698 occurrences of the word "God," and the numbers of verses where they occur. 
This is especially impossible in view of (1) the age of ignorance during which the Quran was revealed, and (2) the fact that the suras and verses were widely separated in time and place of revelation. The chronological order of revelation was vastly different from the ﬁnal format (Appendix 23 ). However, the Quran ’s mathematical system is not limited to the word "God;" it is extremely vast, extremely intricate, and totally comprehensive. 
The Simple Facts 
Like the Quran itself, the Quran ’s mathematical coding ranges from the very simple, to the very complex. The Simple Facts are those observations that can be 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1236 -----------------------------------------------------
ascertained without using any tools. The complex facts require the assistance of a calculator or a computer. The following facts do not require any tools to be veri ﬁed, but please remember they all refer to the original Arabic text: 
1. The ﬁrst verse ( 1:1 ), known as "Basmalah," consists of 19 
letters. 
2. The Quran consists of 114 suras, which is 19 x 6. 
3. The total number of verses in the Quran is 6346, or 19 x 334. 
[6234 numbered verses & 112 un-numbered verses (Basmalahs) 6234+112 = 6346] Note that 6+3+4+6= 
4. The Basmalah occurs 114 times, despite its conspicuous absence from Sura 9 (it occurs twice in Sura 27 ) & 114= 
5. From the missing Basmalah of Sura 9 to the extra Basmalah of Sura 27 , there are precisely 
6. It follows that the total of the sura numbers from 9 to 27 (9+10+11+12+...+26+27) is 342, or

19 suras. 
19 x 18. 
19 x 18. 
8. The famous ﬁrst revelation ( 96:1 -5) consists of 19 
words. 
9. This 19-worded ﬁrst revelation consists of 76 letters 19 x 4. 10. Sura 96 , ﬁrst in the chronological sequence, consists of 19 
verses. 
11. This ﬁrst chronological sura is placed atop the last 19 suras. 12. Sura 96 consists of 304 Arabic letters, and 304 equals 19 x 16. 13. The last revelation (Sura 110 ) consists of 19 
words. 
14. The ﬁrst verse of the last revelation ( 110:1 ) consists of 19 
letters. 
15. 14 different Arabic letters, form 14 different sets of "Quranic Initials" (such as A.L.M. of 2:1 ), and pre ﬁx 29 suras. These numbers add up to 14+14+29=57= 
16. The total of the 29 sura numbers where the Quranic Initials occur is 2+3+7+...+50+68 = 822, and 822+14 (14 sets of initials) equals 836, or 
19 x 3. 
19 x 44. 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1237 -----------------------------------------------------
17. Between the ﬁrst initialed sura (Sura 2 ) and the last initialed sura (Sura 68 ) there are 38 un-initialed suras 
19 x 2. 
18. Between the ﬁrst and last initialed sura there are 19 sets of alternating "initialed" and "uninitialed" suras. 
19. The Quran mentions 30 different numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 19, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 99, 100, 200, 300, 1000, 2000, 3000, 5000, 50,000, & 100,000. The sum of these numbers is 162146, which equals 
This is a condensed summary of the Simple Facts. 
19×8534. 
The Literary Mathematical Composition 
The Quran is characterized by a unique phenomenon never found in any other book; 29 suras are pre ﬁxed with 14 different sets of "Quranic Initials," consisting of one to ﬁve letters per set. Fourteen letters, half the Arabic alphabet, participate in these initials. The signi ﬁcance of the Quranic initials remained a divinely guarded secret for 14 centuries. 
The Quran states in 10:20 and 25:4 -6 that its miracle, i.e., proof of divine authorship, was destined to remain secret for a speci ﬁc predetermined interim: 
They said, "Why hasn ’t a miracle come down to him from his Lord?" Say, "Only God knows the future. Therefore, wait, and I will wait along with you." [ 10:20 ] 
****** 
Those who disbelieved said, "This is no more than a fabrication by him, with the help of other people." Indeed, they uttered a blasphemy; a falsehood. Others said, "Tales from the past that he wrote down; they were dictated to him day and night." Say, "This was sent down from the One who knows `the secret ‘ in the heavens and the earth." Surely, He is Forgiving, Most Merciful. [ 25:4 -6] 
The Quranic Initials constitute a major portion of the Quran ’s 19-based mathematical miracle.

Historical Background 
In 1968, I realized that the existing English translations of the Quran did not present the truthful message of God ’s Final Testament. For example, the two most popular translators, Yusuf Ali and Marmaduke Pickthall, could not overcome their corrupted religious traditions when it came to the Quran ’s great criterion in 39:45 . 
When God ALONE is mentioned, the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter shrink with aversion. But when others are mentioned beside Him, they rejoice. [ 39:45 ] 
Yusuf Ali omitted the crucial word "ALONE" from his translation, and altered the rest of the verse by inserting the word "(gods)." Thus, he utterly destroyed this most important Quranic criterion. He translated 39:45 as follows: 
When God, the One and Only, is mentioned, the hearts of those who believe not in the Hereafter are ﬁlled with disgust and horror; but when (gods) other than He are mentioned, behold, they are ﬁlled with joy. [ 39:45 ] 
(according to A. Yusuf Ali) 
The expression "When God, the One and Only, is mentioned," is not the same as saying, "When God alone is mentioned." One can mention "God, the One and Only," and also mention Muhammad or Jesus, and no one will be upset. But if "God ALONE is mentioned," you cannot mention anyone else, and a lot of people - those who idolize Muhammad or Jesus - will be upset. Thus, Yusuf Ali could not bring himself to present the truth of the Quran, if it exposed his corrupted belief. 
Marmaduke Pickthall translated "ALONE" correctly, but destroyed the criterion by inserting his personal belief in parentheses; he translated 39:45 as follows: 
And when Allah alone is mentioned, the hearts of those who believe not in the Hereafter are repelled, and when those (whom they worship) beside Him are mentioned, behold! they are glad. [ 39:45 ] 
(according to Marmaduke Pickthal) 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1240 -----------------------------------------------------
When I saw the truth of God ’s word thus distorted, I decided to translate the Quran, at least for the bene ﬁt of my own children. Since I was a chemist by profession, and despite my extensive religious background - my father was a renowned Suﬁ leader in Egypt - I vowed to God that I would not move from one verse to the next unless I fully understood it. 
I purchased all the available books of Quranic translations and exegeses (Tafseer) I could ﬁnd, placed them on a large table, and began my translation. The ﬁrst sura, The Key, was completed in a few days. The ﬁrst verse in Sura 2 is "A.L.M." The translation of this verse took four years, and coincided with the divine unveiling of "the secret," the great mathematical Miracle of the Quran. 
The books of Quranic exegeses unanimously agreed that "no one knows the meaning or signiﬁcance of the Quranic Initials A.L.M., or any other initials." I decided to write the Quran into the computer, analyze the whole text, and see if there were any mathematical correlations among these Quranic initials. 
I used a time-share terminal, connected by telephone to a giant computer. To test my hypothesis, I decided to look at the single-lettered Quranic Initials - "Q" (Qaaf) of Suras 42 and 50 , "S" (Saad) of Suras 7 , 19 , and 38 , and "N" (Noon) of Sura 68 . As detailed in my ﬁrst book MIRACLE OF THE QURAN: SIGNIFICANCE OF THE MYSTERIOUS ALPHABETS (Islamic Productions, 1973), many previous attempts to unravel the mystery had failed. 
The Quranic Initial "Q" (Qaaf) 
The computer data showed that the text of the only Q-initialed suras, 42 and 50, contained the same number of Q ’s, 57 and 57. That was the ﬁrst hint that a deliberate mathematical system might exist in the Quran. 
Sura 50 is entitled "Q," preﬁxed with "Q," and the ﬁrst verse reads, "Q, and the glorious Quran." This indicated that "Q" stands for "Quran," and the total number of Q ’s in the two Q-initialed suras represents the Quran ’s 114 suras (57+57 = 114 = 19×6). This idea was strengthened by the fact that "the Quran" occurs in the Quran 57 times. 
The Quran is described in Sura "Q" as "Majid" (glorious), and the Arabic word "Majid" has a gematrical value of 57: M (40)+J (3)+I (10)+D (4) = 57. 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1241 -----------------------------------------------------
Sura 42 consists of 53 verses, and 42+53 = 95 = 19×5. 
Sura 50 consists of 45 verses, and 50+45 = 95, same total as in Sura 42 . 
By counting the letter "Q" in every "Verse 19" throughout the Quran, the total count comes to 76, 19×4. Here is a summary of the Q-related data: 
1. The frequency of occurrence of "Q" in Sura "Q" (No. 50) is 57, 19×3. 
2. The letter "Q" occurs in the other Q-initialed sura (No. 42) exactly the same number of times, 57. 
3. The total occurrence of the letter "Q" in the two Q- initialed suras is 114, which equals the number of suras in the Quran. 
4. "The Quran" is mentioned in the Quran 57 times. 
5. The description of the Quran as "Majid" (Glorious) is correlated with the frequency of occurrence of the letter "Q" in each of the Q-initialed suras. The word "Majid" has a gematrical value of 57. 
7. Sura 42 consists of 53 verses, and 42+53 is 95, or 19×5. 
8. Sura 50 consists of 45 verses, and 50+45 is also 95, 19×5. 
9. The number of Q ’s in all verses numbered "19" throughout the Quran is 76, 19×4. 
Glimpses of the Quran ’s mathematical composition began to emerge. For example, it was observed that the people who disbelieved in Lot are mentioned in 50:13 and occur in the Quran 13 times - 7:80 ; 11:70 , 74, 89; 21:74 ; 22:43 ; 26:160 ; 27:54 , 56; 29:28 ; 38:13 ; 50:13 ; and 54:33 . Consistently, they are referred to as " Qawm ," with the single exception of the Q-initialed Sura 50 where they are referred to as " Ikhwaan ." Obviously, if the regular, Q-containing word " Qawm " were used, the count of the letter "Q" in Sura 50 would have become 58, and this whole phenomenon would have disappeared. With the recognized absolute accuracy of mathematics, the alteration of a single letter destroys the system. 
Another relevant example is the reference to Mecca in 3:96 as " Becca "! This strange spelling of the renowned city has puzzled Islamic scholars for many centuries. Although Mecca is mentioned in the Quran properly spelled in 48:24 , the letter "M" is substituted with a "B" in 3:96 . It turns out that Sura 3 is an M-initialed sura, and the count of the letter "M" would have deviated from the Quran ’s code if "Mecca" was spelled correctly in 3:96 . 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1242 -----------------------------------------------------
NuN (Noon) 
This initial is unique; it occurs in one sura, 68, and the name of the letter is spelled out as three letters - Noon Wow Noon - in the original text, and is therefore counted as two N ’s. The total count of this letter in the N-initialed sura is 133, 19×7. The fact that "N" is the last Quranic Initial (see Table 1) brings out a number of special observations. For example, the number of verses from the ﬁrst Quranic Initial (A.L.M. of 2:1 ) to the last initial (N. of 68:1 ) is 5263, or 19×277. 
The word "God" (Allah) occurs 2641 (19×139) times between the ﬁrst initial and the last initial. Since the total occurrence of the word "God" is 2698, it follows that its occurrence outside the initials "A.L.M." of 2:1 on one side, and the initial "N" of 68:1 on the other side, is 57, 19×3. Tables 9 to 18 prove that the initial "NuN" must be spelled out to show two N ’s. 
S (Saad) 
This initial preﬁxes three suras, 7, 19, and 38, and the total occurrence of the letter "S" (Saad) in these three suras is 152, 19×8 (Table 2). It is noteworthy that in 7:69 , the word "Bastatan" is written in some printings with a "Saad," instead of "Seen."

38 29 
152 (19×8) 
This is an erroneous distortion that violates the Quran ’s code. By looking at the oldest available copy of the Quran, the Tashkent Copy, it was found that the word "Bastatan" is correctly written with a "Seen" (see photocopy below). 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1243 -----------------------------------------------------
Historical Note 
The momentous discovery that "19" is the Quran ’s common denominator became a reality in January 1974, coinciding with Zul-Hijjah 1393 A.H. The Quran was revealed in 13 B.H. (Before Hijrah). This makes the number of years from the revelation of the Quran to the revelation of its miracle 1393 + 13 = 1406 = 19×74. As noted above, the unveiling of the Miracle took place in January 1974. The correlation between 19×74 lunar years and 1974 solar years could not escape notice. This is especially uncanny in view of the fact that "19" is mentioned in Sura 74 . 
Y. S. (Ya Seen) 
These two letters pre ﬁx Sura 36 . The letter "Y" occurs in this sura 237 times, while the letter "S" (Seen) occurs 48 times. The total of both letters is 285, 19×15. 
It is noteworthy that the letter "Y" is written in the Quran in two forms; one is obvious and the other is subtle. The subtle form of the letter may be confusing to those who are not thoroughly familiar with the Arabic language. A good example is the word “ Araany which is mentioned twice in 12:36 . The letter "Y" is used twice in this word, the ﬁrst "Y" is subtle and the second is obvious. Sura 36 does not contain a single "Y" of the subtle type. This is a remarkable phenomenon, and one that does not normally occur in a long sura like Sura 36 . In my book QURAN: VISUAL PRESENTATION OF THE MIRACLE (Islamic Productions, 1982) every "Y" and "S" in Sura 36 is marked with a star. 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1244 -----------------------------------------------------
H.M. (Ha Mim) 
Seven suras are preﬁxed with the letters "H " and "M ;" Suras 40 through 46. The total occurrence of these two letters in the seven H.M.-initialed suras is 2147, or 19×113. The detailed data are shown in Table 3. Naturally, the alteration of a single letter "H" or "M" in any of the seven H.M.-initialed suras would have destroyed this intricate phenomenon.

These initials constitute Verse 2 of Sura 42 , and the total occurrence of these letters in this sura is 209, or 19×11. The letter " `A" (`Ayn) occurs 98 times, the letter "S" (Seen) occurs 54 times, and the letter "Q" (Qaf) occurs 57 times. 
A.L.M. (Alef Laam Mim) 
The letters "A," "L," and "M" are the most frequently used letters in the Arabic language, and in the same order as we see in the Quranic Initials - "A," then "L," 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1245 -----------------------------------------------------
then "M." These letters pre ﬁx six suras - 2, 3, 29, 30, 31, and 32 - and the total occurrence of the three letters in each of the six suras is a multiple of 19 [9899 (19×521), 5662 (19x 298), 1672 (19×88), 1254 (19×66), 817 (19×43), and 570 (19×30), respectively]. Thus, the total occurrence of the three letters in the six suras is 19874 (19x 1046), and the alteration of one of these letters destroys this phenomenon.

Only one sura is preﬁxed with these initials, Sura 7 , and the letter "A" occurs in this sura 2529 times, "L" occurs 1530 times, "M" occurs 1164 times, and "S" (Saad) occurs 97 times. Thus, the total occurrence of the four letters in this sura is 2529+1530+1164+97 = 5320 = 19×280. 
An important observation here is the interlocking relationship involving the letter "S" (Saad). This initial occurs also in Suras 19 and 38 . While complementing its sister letters in Sura 7 to give a total that is divisible by 19, the frequency of this letter also complements its sister letters in Suras 19 and 38 to give a multiple of 19 (see Page 380). 
Additionally, the Quranic Initial "S" (Saad) interacts with the Quranic Initials "K.H.Y. `A." (Kaaf Haa Ya `Ayn) in Sura 19 to give another total that is also a multiple of 19 (see Page 383). This interlocking relationship - which is not unique to the initial "S" (Saad) - contributes to the intricacy of the Quran ’s numerical code. 
K.H.Y.`A.S. (Kaaf Ha Ya `Ayn Saad) 
This is the longest set of initials, consisting of ﬁve letters, and it occurs in one sura, Sura 19 . The letter "K" in Sura 19 occurs 137 times, "H" occurs 175 times, "Y" occurs 343 times, " `A" occurs 117 times, and "S" (Saad) occurs 26 times. Thus, the total occurrence of the ﬁve letters is 137+175+343+117+26 = 798 = 19×42. 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1247 -----------------------------------------------------
H., T.H. (Ta Ha), T.S. (Ta Seen), & T.S.M. (Ta 
Seen Mim) 
An intricate interlocking relationship links these overlapping Quranic Initials to produce a total that is also a multiple of 19. The initial "H." is found in Suras 19 and 20 . The initials "T.H." pre ﬁx Sura 20 . The initials "T.S." are found in Sura 27 , while the initials "T.S.M." pre ﬁx its surrounding Suras 26 & 28. 
It should be noted at this time that the longer, more complex, interlocking and overlapping initials are found in the suras where uncommonly powerful miracles are narrated. For example, the virgin birth of Jesus is given in Sura 19 , which is preﬁxed with the longest set of initials, K.H.Y.`A.S. 
The interlocking initials "H.," "T.H.," "T.S.," and "T.S.M." pre ﬁx suras describing the miracles of Moses, Jesus, and the uncommon occurrences surrounding Solomon and his jinns. God thus provides stronger evidence to support stronger miracles. The frequencies of occurrence of these initials are presented in Table 6.

What Is A "Gematrical Value"? 
When the Quran was revealed, 14 centuries ago, the numbers known today did not exist. A universal system was used where the letters of the Arabic, Hebrew, 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1248 -----------------------------------------------------
Aramaic, and Greek alphabets were used as numerals. The number assigned to each letter is its "Gematrical Value." The numerical values of the Arabic alphabet are shown in Table 7. 
Table 7: Gematrical Values of the Arabic Alphabet 
Other Mathematical Properties of the Initialed Suras 
Fourteen Arabic letters, half the Arabic alphabet, participate in the formation of 14 different sets of Qur-anic Initials. By adding the gematrical value of each one of these letters, plus the number of suras which are preﬁxed with Quranic Initials (29), we obtain a total of 722, or 19x19x2. 
Additionally, if we add the total gematrical value of all 14 initials, plus the number of the ﬁrst sura where the initial occurs, we get a grand total of 988, 19×52. Table 8 presents these data.

If we add the number of occurrences of each of the 14 letters listed in Table 8 as an initial, plus the numbers of the suras where it occurs as an initial, the Grand Total comes to 2033, 19×107. See Table 9.

Table 10 presents the total frequency of Quranic Initials, plus the total gematrical value of these letters in the whole sura. The Grand Total for all initialed suras is 1089479. This number, in excess of one million, is a multiple of 19 (1089479 = 19 x 57341). The slightest alteration or distortion destroys the system. 
Note: The total gematrical value of the Quranic Initials in a given sura equals the gematrical value of each initial multiplied by the frequency of occurrence of that initial in the sura. 
Major Parameters of the Quranic Initials (Suras, Verses, Frequency, First Sura, & Last Sura) 
Table 11 shows that the sum of numbers of suras and verses where the Quranic Initials are found, plus the initial ’s frequency of occurrence in that sura, plus the number of the ﬁrst sura where the initials occur, plus the number of the last sura where the initials occur, produces a total that equals 44232, or 19×2348. Thus, the distribution of the Quranic Initials in the initialed suras is so intricate that their counts and their placement within suras are intertwined to give a grand total that is a multiple of 19.

A special mathematical coding authenticates the number of verses where the Quranic Initials themselves are found. As detailed in Table 11, all Quranic Initials occur in Verse 1, except in Sura 42 (initials in Verses 1 and 2). This fact is supported by the remarkable mathematical phenomenon detailed in Table 12. If we multiply the ﬁrst two columns of Table 12, instead of adding, we still end up with a Total that is divisible by 19 (see Table 13).

Obviously, it is crucial to have two different initialed verses in Sura 42 in order to conform with the Quran ’s mathematical code. The fact that Verse 1 of Sura 42 consists of the two Quranic Initials "H.M." and the second verse consists of the 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1255 -----------------------------------------------------
three Initials " `A.S.Q." has perplexed Muslim scholars and orientalists for 14 centuries. 
By the end of this Appendix, the read-er will see that every element of the Quran is mathematically authenticated. The elements we are dealing with now are "the number of Quranic Initials in each initialed sura" and "the number of verses that contain Quranic Initials." Tables 11 through 13 have dealt with these two elements. 
Additional mathematical authentication is shown in Tables 14 and 15. In Table 14, we have the numbers of all initialed suras added to the number of verses in each sura, plus the number of verses containing initials, plus the gematrical values of those initials. The Grand Total is 7030, or 19×370.

Remarkably, if we multiply the ﬁrst two columns of Table 14, instead 
of adding them, we still get a Grand Total that is divisible by 19 
(Table 15). 
The number of verses per sura, and the numbers assigned to each verse are among the basic elements of the Quran. Not only are these elements authenticated mathematically, but both initialed and un-initialed suras are independently coded. Since we are now dealing with the initialed suras, Table 16 presents the numbers assigned to these suras, added to the numbers of verses in each sura, plus the sum of verse numbers (1+2+3+ ... + n). The Grand total is 190133, or 19×10007.

By adding the number of every sura to the number of the next sura, and accumulating the sums of sura numbers as we continue this process to the end of the Quran, we will have a value that corresponds to each sura. Thus, Sura 1 will have a corresponding value of 1, Sura 2 will have a value of 1+2=3, Sura 3 will have a value of 3+3=6, Sura 4 will have a value of 6+4 = 10, and so on to

the end of the Quran. The total values for the initialed and the un-initialed suras are independently divisible by 19. The values for the initialed suras are shown in Table 17. 
The values calculated for the un-initialed suras add up to a total of 237785, which is also a multiple of 19 (237785 = 19×12515). 
Mathematical Coding of Special Words The 
Word "God" (Allah) 
[1] As shown earlier the word "God" occurs in the Quran 2698 times, 19×142. 
[2] The numbers of verses where the word "God" occurs add up to 118123, also a multiple of 19 (118123 = 19×6217). 
These simple phenomena gave us many difﬁculties while simply counting the word "God." We were a group of workers, equipped with computers, and all of us college graduates. Yet, we made several errors in counting, calculating, or simply writing the counts of the word "God." Those who still claim that Muhammad was the author of the Quran are totally illogical; he never went to college, and he did not have a computer. 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1259 -----------------------------------------------------
[3] From the ﬁrst Quranic Initials (A.L.M. 2:1 ) to the last initial (N. 68:1 ), there are 2641, 19 x 139, occurrences of the word "God." 
[4] The word "God" occurs 57 times in the section outside the Initials (Table 18). 
[5] By adding the numbers of the suras and verses where these 57 occurrences of the word "God" are found, we get a total of 2432, or 19×128. See Table 18. 
[6] The word "God" occurs in 85 suras. If we add the number of each sura to the number of verses between the ﬁrst and last occurrences of the word "God," both verses inclusive, the Grand Total comes to 8170 or 19 x 430. An abbreviated representation of the data is shown in Table 19.

These mathematical properties cover all occurrences of the word "God." 
[7] The Quran ’s dominant message is that there is only "One God." The word "One," in Arabic " Wahed " occurs in the Quran 25 times. Six of these occurrences refer to other than God (one kind of food, one door, etc.). The other 19 occurrences 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1261 -----------------------------------------------------
refer to God. These data are found in the classic reference INDEX TO THE WORDS OF QURAN . 
WHY 19! 
As pointed out later in this Appendix, all God ’s scriptures, not only the Quran, were mathematically coded with the number "19." Even the universe at large bears this divine mark. The number 19 can be looked upon as the Almighty Creator ’s signature on everything He created (see Appendix 38 ). The number "19" possesses unique mathematical properties beyond the scope of this Appendix. For example: 
[1] It is a prime number. 
[2] It encompasses the ﬁrst numeral (1) and the last numeral (9), as if to proclaim God ’s attribute in 57:3 as the "Alpha and the Omega." 
[3] It looks the same in all languages of the world. Both components, 1 and 9, are the only numerals that look the same in all languages. 
[4] It possesses many peculiar mathematical properties. For example, 19 is the sum of the ﬁrst powers of 9 and 10, and the difference between the second powers of 9 and 10. 
We now understand that the universal coding of God ’s creations with the number 19 rests in the fact that it is the gematrical value of the word "ONE" in all the scriptural languages - Aramaic, Hebrew, and Arabic. 
The number 19, therefore, pro-claims the First Commandment in all the scriptures: that there is only ONE God. 
The Lord our God is ONE! Therefore, you shall worship the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength. [Deuteronomy 6:4-5] [Mark 12:29 ] [Quran 2:163 , 17:22 -23] 
As shown in Table 7, the Aramaic, Hebrew, and Arabic alphabets used to double as numerals in accordance with a universally established system. The Hebrew word for "ONE" is "VAHD" (pronounced V-AHAD). In Arabic, the word for "ONE" is "WAHD" (pronounced WAAHED). See Table 20.

The Word "Quran" 
The word "Quran" occurs in the Quran 58 times, with one of them, in 10:15 , referring to "another Quran." This particular occurrence, therefore, must be excluded. Thus, the frequency of occurrence of "this Quran" in the Quran is 57, or 19×3.

Two other grammatical forms of the word "Quran" occur in 12 verses. These include the word "Quranun" and the word "Quranahu." One of these occurrences, in 13:31 refers to "another Quran" that cause the mountains to crumble. Another occurrence, in 41:44 , refers to "a non-Arabic Quran." These two occurrences, therefore, are excluded. Table 21 shows a list of the suras and verses where the word "Quran," in all its grammatical forms, occurs. 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1265 -----------------------------------------------------
A STRONG FOUNDATION 
The Quran ’s ﬁrst verse, "In the Name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful," known as Basmalah , consists of 19 Arabic letters. Its constituent words occur in the Quran consistently in multiples of 19. 
The ﬁrst word "Ism" (Name) occurs 19 times. 
The second word "Allah" (God) occurs 2698 times (19×142). The third word "Al-Rahman" (Most Gracious) 57 times, 19×3. 
The fourth word "Al-Raheem" (Most Merciful) 114 times, 19×6. 
Professor Cesar Majul looked at the gematrical value of more than 400 attributes of God, and found only four names whose gematrical vaues are multiples of 19: 
Divine Name Gematrical Value 
1. "Waahed" (One) 19 
2. "Zul Fadl Al-`Azim" (Possessor of Inﬁnite Grace) 2698 
3. "Majid" (Glorious) 57 
4. "Jaami` " (Summoner) 114 
As noted above, the only Divine Names whose gematrical values are divisible by 19 correspond exactly to the frequencies of occurrence of the Basmalah ‘s four words. The ﬁgure below illustrates this remarkable phenomenon: 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1266 -----------------------------------------------------
The four words of Basmalah are shown on the left side, and the only four divine names whose gematrical values are divisible by 19 are on the right side. The numbers in the middle are the frequencies of occurrence of the words of Basmalah, and, at the same time, the gematrical values of the four divine names. 
The Five Pillars of Islam 
Although the Quran provides numerous important commandments governing all aspects of our lives (see for example 17:22 -38), ﬁve basic "pillars" have been traditionally emphasized. They are: 
1. Shahaadah : Bearing witness that there is no other god besides God. 
2. Salat : Observing ﬁve daily Contact Prayers. 
3. Seyaam : Fasting during the ninth month of the Islamic calendar (Ramadan). 4. Zakat : Giving away 2.5% of one ’s net income as a charity to speciﬁed people. 5. Hajj : Pilgrimage to Mecca once in a lifetime for those who can afford it. 
Like everything else in the Quran, these are mathematically structured. 
1. One God (Shahaadah) : 
As mentioned earlier, the word "ONE" that refers to God occurs in the Quran 19 times. The reference to God "ALONE" occurs 5 times, and the sum of the sura and verse numbers where we ﬁnd these ﬁve occurrences is 361, 19×19.Table 22: All Suras and Verses from First Occurrence of LAA ELAAHA ELLA HOO to the Last Occurrence.

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1267 -----------------------------------------------------
(19×16658) 
The "First Pillar of Islam" is stated in 3:18 as " LAA ELAAHA ELLA HOO " (There is no other god besides Him). This most important expression occurs in 19 suras. The ﬁrst occurrence is in 2:163 , and the last occurrence is in 73:9 . Table 22 shows that the total of sura numbers, plus the number of verses between the ﬁrst and last occurrences, plus the sum of these verse numbers is 316502, or 19x 16658. 
Also, by adding the numbers of the 19 suras where LAA ELAAHA ELLA HOO occurs, plus the verse numbers where this crucial expression is found, plus the total number of occurrences (29), the Grand Total comes to 2128, or 19×112. The details are shown in Table 23.

2. The Contact Prayers "Salat" : 
The word " Salat " occurs in the Quran 67 times, and when we add the numbers of suras and verses of these 67 occurrences, the total comes to 4674, or 19×246 (see INDEX OF THE QURAN ). 
3. Fasting (Seyaam) : 
The commandment to fast is mentioned in 2:183 , 184, 185, 187, 196; 4:92 ; 5:89 , 95; 33:35 , 35; & 58:4 . The total of these numbers is 1387, or 19×73. It is noteworthy that 33:35 mentions fasting twice, one for the believing men, and the other for the believing women. 
4. The Obligatory Charity (Zakat):& 5. Hajj Pilgrimage to Mecca : 
While the ﬁrst three "Pillars of Islam" are obligatory upon all Muslim men and women, the Zakat and Hajj are decreed only for those who can afford them. This explains the interesting mathematical phenomenon associated with Zakat and Hajj. The Zakat charity is mentioned in 2:43 , 83, 110, 177, 277; 4:77 , 162; 5:12 , 55, 7:156 ; 9:5 , 11, 18, 71; 18:81 ; 19:13 , 31, 55; 21:73 ; 22:41 , 78; 23:4 ; 24:37 , 56; 27:3 ; 30:39 ; 31:4 ; 33:33 ; 41:7 ; 58:13 ; 73:20 ; and 98:5 . These numbers add up to 2395. This total does not quite make it as a multiple of 19; it is up by 1. 
The Hajj Pilgrimage occurs in 2:189 , 196, 197; 9:3 ; and 22:27 . These numbers add up to 645, and this total does not quite make it as a multiple of 19; it is down by 1. 
Thus, Zakat and Hajj, together, give a total of 2395+645 = 3040 = 19×160. 
THE QURAN ’S MATHEMATICAL 
STRUCTURE 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1269 -----------------------------------------------------
The Quran ’s suras, verses, words, and letters are not only mathematically composed, but also arranged into a superhuman structure that is purely mathematical, i.e., the literary content has nothing to do with such an arrangement. Since the physical construction of the Quran is purely mathematical, it would be expected that the numbers mentioned in the Quran must conform with the Quran ’s 19-based code. 
A total of 30 unique numbers are mentioned throughout the Quran, and the sum of all these numbers is 162146, a multiple of 19 (162146 = 19×8534). Table 24 lists all the numbers mentioned in the Quran, without the repetitions. 
The numbers which are mentioned only once in the Quran are: 11, 19, 20, 50, 60, 80, 99, 300, 2000, 3000, 5000, 50000, and 100000. All the numbers mentioned in the Quran, with repetitions, occur 285 times, and this number is a multiple of 19; 285 = 19×15. 
The Numbers of Suras and Verses 
The numbering system of the Quran ’s suras and verses has been perfectly preserved. Only a few unauthorized and easily detectable printings deviate from the standard system that is divinely guarded. When we add the numbers of all suras, plus the number of verses in every sura, plus the sum of verse numbers, the Grand total for the whole Quran comes to 346199, 19x19x959. Table 25 is an abbreviated presentation of these data. Thus, the slightest alteration of a single sura or verse would have destroyed this system. As shown in Table 16, if we consider only the 29 initialed suras, these same data produce a Grand Total which is also a multiple of 19. It follows that the data for the un-initialed suras are also divisible by 19.

Total is 757 digits & a multiple of 19 
Write down the sura number, followed by the number of verses in that sura, then the number of every verse, and ﬁnally, the sum of verse numbers. So, for Sura 1 you would write 1 for the sura, then 7 for the number of verses, 1234567 for each verse number, and ﬁnally 28 for the sum of verse numbers, i.e. 1 7 1234567 28. The number for Sura 2 will look like this: 2 286 123456.... 286 41041. Do the same for all the 114 suras, and than add these numbers. The total consists of 759 digits, and is a multiple of 19. 
Now write down the total number of verses in a sura, followed by the sum of verse numbers, and keep all numbers justiﬁed to the left. For example, the number of verses in Sura 1 is 7, and the sum of verse numbers is 28. Thus, the combined number for Sura 1 will be 7 28, for Sura 2 it will be 286 41041, for Sura 3 it will be 200 20100; and so on to Sura 114 for which the combined number is 6 21. 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1273 -----------------------------------------------------
Remember that these numbers are written all the way to the left, as shown in Table 28. Then add them in the usual manner, from right to left. The total of all these left justiﬁed numbers is 4,859,309,774, or 19 x 255753146. 
Finally, do the same thing as above (continuing to keep all numbers left justi ﬁed), except write down the number of every verse, instead of the total number of verses. For example, the number for Sura 1 consists of its seven verse numbers (1234567) combined with the sum of those numbers (28). Thus, the combined number for Sura 1 will be 1234567 28. The combined number for Sura 114 will be 123456 21. Table 29 demonstrates this process. The total of all these left justiﬁed numbers consists of 757 digits, and is still a multiple of 19. 
Superhuman Numerical Combinations 
Let us write down the number of each verse in the Quran, preceded for each sura by the number of verses in that sura. Thus, Sura 1 , which consists of seven verses, will be represented by the number 7 1234567. What we are doing here is forming long numbers by writing the numbers of verses next to each other. To ﬁnd the number representing Sura 2 , you write down the number of verses in this sura, 286, followed by the number of every verse, written next to each other. Thus, the 
number representing Sura 2 will look like this: 286 12345.....284285286. The two 
numbers representing the ﬁrst two suras are: 
7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 & 286 1 2 3 4 5.....284 285 286. Putting these two numbers together 
to form one number representing the ﬁrst two suras, we get this number: 
7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 286 1 2 3 4 5.....284 285 286. This process is continued until every 
verse in the Quran is written down, thus forming one very long number encompassing the number of every verse in the Quran. The number representing the whole Quran is a multiple of 19 & consists of 12692 digits, which is also a multiple of 19. 
7 1234567 286 12345...286 ...5 12345 6 123456 
FIRST No: This very long number consists of 12692 digits (19×668) and includes every verse in the Quran. The number of verses in each sura precedes its verses. A special computer program that divides very long numbers has shown that this long number is a multiple of 19. 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1274 -----------------------------------------------------
Instead of putting the total number of verses in every sura ahead of the sura, let us put it at the end of every sura. Thus, the number representing Sura 1 will look like this: 1234567 7, instead of 7 1234567. The number representing Sura 2 will look 
like this: 12345.....284 285 286 286 instead of 286 12345.....284285286. The 
numbers representing the ﬁrst two suras will look like this: 
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 7 & 1 2 3 4 5.....284 285 286 286. Putting these two numbers together 
to form a longer number representing the ﬁrst two suras, we get a number that looks like this: 
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 7 1 2 3 4 5.....284 285 286 286. Since we are putting the total number 
of verses per sura at the end of each sura, we must put the total number of numbered verses (6234) at the end of the Quran. The last numbers, therefore, represent the last sura (123456 6), followed by the total number of numbered verses in the Quran (6234): 
1 2 3 4 5 6 6 & 6234 >>>>>>1 2 3 4 5 6 6 6234. Putting together all the verses of all the suras, produces a long number that consists of 12696 digits, and is a multiple of 19. 
1234567 7 12345...286 286 12345 5...123456 6 6234 
SECOND No: The number of every verse in every sura is followed by the number of verses per sura. The last 11 digits shown here are the 6 verses of the last sura, followed by its number of verses (6), followed by the total number of numbered verses in the Quran (6234). The complete, very long number, is a multiple of 19. 
Now let us include the number of every sura. 
Write down the number of every verse in every sura, followed by the number of the sura, followed by the number of verses in the sura. Thus, the number representing Sura 1 looks like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 7. The number representing Sura 2 looks like 
this: 1 2 3 4 5 .....284 285 286 2 286. The number representing the last sura (No. 
114) looks like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 114 6. Again, the total number of numbered verses (6234) is added at the end. This number, representing the whole Quran, is a multiple of 19 ; it looks like this: 
1234567 1 7 12345...286 2 286 ...123456 114 6 6234 
THIRD No: The number of every verse, followed by the sura number, then 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1275 -----------------------------------------------------
the number of verses in the sura. The total number of numbered verses is added at the end. The long number (12930 digits) is a multiple of 19. 
Instead of putting the total number of verses in every sura after the sura, let us now put it ahead of the sura. Thus, the number representing Sura 1 looks like this: 7 1234567 1, instead of 1234567 1 7, and the number representing Sura 2 looks like 
this: 286 12345.....284 285 286 2, instead of 12345.....284 285 286 2 286. This very 
long number representing the whole Quran is a multiple of 19 . 
7 1234567 1 286 12345...286 2...6 123456 114 6234 
FOURTH No: The total number of verses in each sura is followed by the number of every verse, then the sura number. The last 14 digits shown above are the number of verses in the last sura (6), followed by the numbers of the six verses (123456), followed by the number of the sura (114), then the total number of numbered verses in the Quran. 
The very long number (consisting of 12930 digits) is a multiple of 19. 
Now, let us write down the number of every verse in every sura, followed by the sum of verse numbers for every sura. Sura 1 consists of 7 verses, and the sum of verse numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7 = 28. Thus, the number representing Sura 1 looks like this: 1234567 28. 
The sum of verse numbers for Sura 2 is 41041 (1+2+3+ ... + 286). Thus, the number representing Sura 2 looks like this: 12345...284 285 286 41041. 
The number representing the last sura, which consists of 6 verses, looks like this: 123456 21, since 1+2+3+4+5+6 = 21. 
The complete number, representing the whole Quran, consists of 12836 digits and is a multiple of 19 . It looks like this: 
1234567 28 12345...284285286 41041...123456 21 
FIFTH No: The number of every verse in every sura is followed by the sum of verse numbers. The long number consists of 12836 digits, and is a multiple of 19. 
Remarkably, if we take the "Fifth No." shown above and reverse the order of verse numbers and sum of verse numbers, i.e., move the sum of verse numbers, and put it 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1276 -----------------------------------------------------
ahead of the sura, the resulting long number is still a multiple of 19 . 
28 1234567 41041 12345....285286.....21 123456 
SIXTH No: Placing the sum of verse numbers ahead of each sura, instead of after it, produces a long number (12836 digits) that is also a multiple of 19. 
Even writing the suras backward, i.e., reversing the order of suras by starting with the last sura and ending with the ﬁrst sura, and placing the sum of verse numbers after the verses of each sura, the product is still a multiple of 19 
123456 21 12345 15..12345..286 41041 1234567 28 
SEVENTH No: Reversing the order of suras - starting from the last sura and ending with the ﬁrst sura - and writing down the number of every verse, with the sum of verse numbers for every sura after its verses, the product is a long number consisting of 12836 digits. This long number is a multiple of 19. 
Write the sum of verse numbers for the whole Quran (333410), followed by the total number of numbered verses in the Quran (6234), then the number of suras (114). Every sura is then represented by its number followed by its number of verses. The numbers representing Suras 1 and 2 are 1 7 and 2 286. The complete number, covering all suras of the Quran, consists of 474 digits, and is a multiple of 19 - it looks like this: 
333410 6234 114 1 7 2 286 3 200..113 5 114 6 
EIGHTH No: The Grand Sum of verse numbers (333410) is followed by the total number of numbered verses (6234), the number of suras (114), then the sura numbers and numbers of verses of every sura. 
Now let us reverse the order of sura number and its number of verses as presented in the "Eighth No." Thus, the numbers representing the ﬁrst two suras look like this: 7 1 & 286 2, instead of 1 7 & 2 286. The complete number also consists of 474 digits and is still a multiple of 19 . It looks like this: 
333410 6234 114 7 1 286 2 200 3...5 113 6 114 
NINTH No: Reversing the sequence of sura number and number of verses still gives us a long number that is a multiple of 19. 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1277 -----------------------------------------------------
If we write down the sum of verse numbers for Sura 1 (28), followed by the sum of verse numbers for Sura 2 (41041), and so on to the end of the Quran, and placing the Grand Sum of verse numbers (333410) at the end, the resulting long number (Tenth No.) consists of 377 digits, and is a multiple of 19. 
28 41041 20100 ..... 15 21 333410 
TENTH No: The sums of verse numbers for every sura in the Quran, are written next to each other, followed at the end by the Grand Sum of verse numbers (333410). This long number (377 digits) is a multiple of 19. 
If we write down the number of suras in the Quran (114), followed by the total number of numbered verses (6234), followed by the number of every sura and its sum of verse numbers, the ﬁnal long number (612 digits) is a multiple of 19. 
114 6234 1 28 2 41041 3 20100...113 15 114 21 
ELEVENTH No: The number of suras, followed by the total number of numbered verses, then the number of every sura and its sum of verse numbers, produce this long number (612 digits) that is a multiple of 19. 
Lest anyone may think that any Quranic parameter is left un-guarded with this awesome mathematical code, let us look at more parameters. 
If we write down the number of suras (114), followed by the total number of numbered verses, followed by the Grand Sum of verse numbers in the whole Quran (333410), followed by the numbers of every sura and its verses, we end up with a very long number (12712 digits) that is a multiple of 19. 
114 6234 333410 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7...114 1 2 3 4 5 6 
TWELFTH NUMBER 
If we write down the numbers of verses in every sura next to each other, we end up with a 235-digit number that is a multiple of 19. To do this, write down the total number of numbered verses in the Quran (6234), followed by the number of verses in every sura, then close with the total number of numbered verses in the Quran. The ﬁnal long number looks like this: 
6234 7 286 200 176 ..... 
127 
.... 5 4 56 6234

THIRTEENTH 
NUMBER 
If we write down the number of numbered verses in the Quran (6234), followed by the number of suras (114), followed by the number of every verse in every sura, then close with the number of numbered verses in the Quran (6234) and the number of suras (114), the ﬁnal number consists of 12479 digits, and is a multiple of 19. 
6234 114 1234567 12345...286...123456 6234 114 
FOURTEENTH NUMBER 
Another long number that consists of 12774 digits is formed by writing down the number of every verse in every sura, followed by the number of every sura added to its number of verses. Sura 1 consists of 7 verses, and the total 1+7 is 8. Therefore, the number representing Sura 1 looks like this: 1234567 8. Since Sura 2 consists of 286 verses, the number representing Sura 2 looks like this: 12345...286 288. This is done for every sura in the Quran. The ﬁnal combined number consists of 12774 digits, and is a multiple of 19.

A Witness From the Children of Israel [ 46:10 ] 
Proclaim: "What if it is from God, and you disbelieved in it? A witness from the Children of Israel has borne witness to a similar phenomenon, and he has believed, while you have turned too arrogant to believe. God does not guide the wicked." [ 46:10 ] 
The following quotation is taken from STUDIES IN JEWISH MYSTICISM , (Association for Jewish Studies, Cambridge, Mass., Joseph Dan & Frank Talmage, 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1279 -----------------------------------------------------
eds., Page 88, 1982). The quotation refers to the work of Rabbi Judah the Pious (12th Century AD): 
The people [Jews] in France made it a custom to add [in the morning prayer] the words: " ‘Ashrei temimei derekh [blessed are those who walk the righteous way]," and our Rabbi, the Pious, of blessed memory, wrote that they were completely and utterly wrong. It is all gross falsehood, because there are only nineteen times that the Holy Name is mentioned [in that portion of the morning prayer]... and similarly you ﬁnd the word ‘Elohim nineteen times in the pericope of Ve- ‘elleh shemot. . . . Similarly, you ﬁnd that Israel were called "sons" nineteen times, and there are many other examples. All these sets of nineteen are intricately intertwined, and they contain many secrets and esoteric meanings, which are contained in more than eight large volumes. . . Furthermore, in this section there are 152 (19× 8) words.

Appendix 2 
God's Messenger of the 
Covenant[ 74:35 ] 
God's Messenger of the Covenant is a consolidating messenger. His mission is to purify and unify all existing religions into one: Islam (Submission). 
Islam is NOT a name; it is a description of one's total submission and devotion to God ALONE, without idolizing Jesus, Mary, Muhammad, or the saints. Anyone who meets this criterion is a "Muslim" (Submitter). Therefore, one may be a Muslim Jew, a Muslim Christian, a Muslim Hindu, a Muslim Buddhist, or Muslim Muslim. 
God's Messenger of the Covenant delivers God's proclamation that "The only religion approved by God is Submission" ( 3:19 ) and that "Anyone who seeks other than Submission as a religion, it will not be accepted from him/her" ( 3:85 ). 
A messenger of God must present proof that he is God's messenger. Every messenger of God is supported by incontrovertible divine signs proving that he is authorized by the Almighty to deliver His messages. Moses threw down his staff and it turned into a serpent, Jesus healed the leprous and revived the dead by God's leave, Saaleh's sign was the famous camel, Abraham walked out of the ﬁre, and Muhammad's miracle was the Quran ( 29:50 -51). 
The Quran ( 3:81 , 33:7 , 33:40 ) and the Bible (Malachi 3:1-3) have prophesied the advent of the consolidating messenger, God's Messenger of the Covenant. It is only beﬁtting that a messenger with such a crucial mission must be supported by the most powerful miracle ( 74:30 -35). While the miracles of previous messengers were limited in time and place, God's miracle supporting His Messenger of the Covenant is perpetual; it can be witnessed by anyone, at anytime, in any place. 
This Appendix presents physical, examinable, veri ﬁable, and irrefutable evidence that Rashad Khalifa is God's Messenger of the Covenant. 
A Quranic Truth 
One of the major prophecies in the Quran is that God's Messenger of the Covenant will be sent after all the prophets have come to this world, and after all of God's scriptures have been delivered. 
God took a covenant from the prophets, saying, "I will give you the scripture and wisdom. Afterwards, a messenger will come to conﬁrm all existing scriptures. You shall believe in him and 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1281 -----------------------------------------------------
support him." He said, "Do you agree with this, and pledge to fulﬁll this covenant?" They said, "We agree." He said, "You have thus borne witness, and I bear witness along with you." [ 3:81 ] 
Muhammad Marmaduke Pickthall translated 3:81 as follows: 
When Allah made (His) covenant with the Prophets, (He said): Behold that which I have given you of the Scripture and knowledge. And afterward there will come unto you a messenger, conﬁrming that which ye possess. Ye shall believe in him and ye shall help him. He said: Do ye agree, and will ye take up My burden (which I lay upon you) in this (matter)? They answered: We agree. He said: Then bear witness. I will be a witness with you. 
We learn from Sura 33 that Muhammad was one of the prophets who made that solemn covenant with God. 
And when we exacted a covenant from the Prophets, and from thee (O Muhammad) and from Noah and Abraham and Moses and Jesus son of Mary, We took from them a solemn covenant. [ 33:7 ] (according to Muhammad Marmaduke Pickthall) 
Verse 3:81 , among many other verses, provides the de ﬁnitions of "Nabi" (Prophet) and "Rasoul" (Messenger). Thus, "Nabi" is a messenger of God who delivers a new scripture, while "Rasoul" is a messenger commissioned by God to conﬁrm existing scripture; he does not bring a new scripture. According to the Quran, every "Nabi" is a "Rasoul," but not every "Rasoul" is a "Nabi." 
Not every messenger was given a new scripture. It is not logical that God will give a scripture to a prophet, then ask him to keep it exclusively for himself, as stated by some Muslim "scholars" ( 2:42 , 146, 159). Those who are not sufﬁciently familiar with the Quran tend to think that Aaron was a "Nabi," as stated in 19:53 , who did not receive a scripture. However, the Quran clearly states that the Torah was given speciﬁcally "to both Moses and Aaron" ( 21:48 , 37:117 ). 
We learn from the Quran, 33:40 , that Muhammad was the last prophet (Nabi), but not the last messenger (Rasoul): 
Muhammad was not the father of any of your men; he was a messenger (Rasoul) of God and the last prophet (Nabi). [ 33:40 ] 
This crucial deﬁnition is conﬁrmed by the Quran's mathematical code. The expression used in 33:40 , "Muhammad Khaatum Al-Nabiyyeen" (the last prophet) has a gematrical value of 1349, 19x71, while the value of the erroneous expression "Muhammad Khaatum Al-Mursaleen" (the last messenger) is not a multiple of 19. 
From time immemorial, it has been a human trait to reject a contemporary, living messenger. Joseph was declared "the last messenger" ( 40:34 ). Yet, many messengers came after him, including Moses, David, Solomon, Jesus, and Muhammad. 
The Covenant Fulﬁlled 
Although the prophets are dead, as far as this world is concerned, we know that their souls, the real persons, are now in the Garden of Eden where Adam & Eve lived. Several verses enjoin us from thinking that the believers who shed their bodies and departed this world are dead ( 2:154 , 3:169 , 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1282 -----------------------------------------------------
4:69 ). Although they cannot come back to our world ( 23:100 ), they are "alive" in Paradise. Please see Appendix 17 . 
During my Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, and before sunrise on Tuesday, Zul-Hijjah 3, 1391, December 21, 1971, I, Rashad Khalifa, the soul, the real person, not the body, was taken to some place in the universe where I was introduced to all the prophets as God's Messenger of the Covenant. I was not informed of the details and true signi ﬁcance of this event until Ramadan 1408. 
What I witnessed, in sharp consciousness, was that I was sitting still, while the prophets, one by one, came towards me, looked at my face, then nodded their heads. God showed them to me as they had looked in this world, attired in their respective mode of dress. There was an atmosphere of great awe, joy, and respect. 
Except for Abraham, none of the prophets was identiﬁed to me. I knew that all the prophets were there, including Moses, Jesus, Muhammad, Aaron, David, Noah, and the rest. I believe that the reason for revealing Abraham's identity was that I asked about him. I was taken aback by the strong resemblance he had with my own family - myself, my father, my uncles. It was the only time that I wondered, "Who is this prophet who looks like my relatives?" The answer came: "Abraham." No language was spoken. All communication was done mentally. 
It is noteworthy that the date of this fulﬁllment of the prophets' covenant was Zul-Hijja 3, 1391. If we add the month (12), plus the day (3), plus the year (1391), we get a total of 1406, 19x74. Sura 74 is where the Quran's common denominator, the number 19, is mentioned. Note that the number 1406 is also the number of years from the revelation of the Quran to the revelation of its miracle (Appendix 1 ). 
The mission of God's Messenger of the Covenant is to con ﬁrm existing scriptures, purify them, and consolidate them into one divine message. The Quran states that such a messenger is charged with restoring God's message to its pristine purity, to lead the righteous believers - Jews, Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, Sikhs, Hindus, and others - out of darkness into the light ( 5:19 & 65:11 ). He is to proclaim that Islam (total submission to God) is the only religion acceptable by God ( 3:19 ). 
"Lo, I am sending my messenger to prepare the way before me; and suddenly there will come to the temple the Lord whom you seek and the messenger of the covenant whom you desire. Yes, he is coming, says the Lord of hosts. But who will endure the day of his coming? And who can stand when he appears? For he is like the re ﬁner's ﬁre, or like the fuller's lye." [Malachi 3:1-2] 
The Proof 
The name of God's Messenger of the Covenant is mathematically coded into the Quran as "Rashad Khalifa." This is certainly the most appropriate method of introducing God's messenger to the world in the computer-age. 
(1) As shown in Appendix 1 , God's great miracle in the Quran is based on the prime number 19, and it remained hidden for 1406 years (19x74). This awesome miracle was predestined by Almighty God to be unveiled through Rashad Khalifa. Hundreds of Muslim and Orientalist scholars during the last 14 centuries have tried in vain, but none of them was permitted to decipher the signi ﬁcance of the Quranic Initials. 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1283 -----------------------------------------------------
(2) The Quran is made easy for the sincere believers and seekers ( 54:17 , 22, 32, 40 & 39:28 ). It is an irrevocable divine law that no one is permitted access to the Quran, let alone its great miracle, unless he or she is a sincere believer who is given speciﬁc divine authorization ( 17:45 -46, 18:57 , 41:44 , 56:79 ). The unveiling of the Quran's miracle through Rashad Khalifa is a major sign of his messengership. 
(3) The root word of the name "Rashad 
" is "Rashada " (to uphold the right 
guidance). This root word is mentioned in the Quran 19 times. Nineteen is the Quran's common denominator (see INDEX TO THE WORDS OF QURAN, First Printing, Page 320). 
(4) The word "Rashad" occurs in 40:29 & 38. The word "Khalifa" occurs in 2:30 and 38:26 . The ﬁrst "Khalifa" refers to a non-human "Khalifa," namely, Satan, while the second occurrence (Sura 38 ), refers to a human "Khalifa." If we add the numbers of suras and verses of "Rashad" ( 40:29 , 38) and "Khalifa" ( 38:26 ) we get 40+29+38+38+26 = 171 = 19x9. 
(5) The sum of all sura and verse numbers where all "Rashada" and all "Khalifa" occur, without discrimination, add up to 1463, 19x77 (Table 1).

224 + 1145 + 38 + 56 = 1463 = 19 
x 77 
(6) The total of all suras and verses where the root word "Rashada" occurs is 1369, or (19x72)+1, while the total for all occurrences of "Khalifa" is 94, (19x5)-1. The fact that "Rashada" is up by one and "Khalifa" is down by one pins down the name as "Rashad Khalifa," and not any "Rashad" or any "Khalifa." 
(7) The gematrical value of "Rashad" is 505 and the value of "Khalifa" is 725 (Table 7, Appendix 1 ). If we add the value of "Rashad Khalifa" (1230) to the sura numbers, and the number of verses, from the beginning of the Quran to the ﬁrst occurrence of "Rashada," the total is 1425, 19x75. The details are given in Table 2.

(19x907) 
Also, "Rashad" (505) + "Khalifa" (725) + Sura Total (3) + Total of Verses (192) = 1425 (19x75) 505 + 725 + 3 + 192 = 1425 = 19x75 
(8) If we add the numbers of all the verses in every sura, i.e., the sum of verse numbers (1+2+3+ ...+n) from the beginning of the Quran to the ﬁrst occurrence of the root word "Rashada," the total comes to 17233, 19x907 (Table 2). 
(9) The Quranic Initials constitute the basic foundation of the Quran's miracle. These initials occur in suras 2 , 3 , 7 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 19 , 20 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 36 , 38 , 40 , 41 , 42 , 43 , 44 , 45 , 46, 50, and 68. If we add the sum of these numbers (822) to the value of "Rashad Khalifa" (1230), the total is 2052, 19x108. 
(10) As shown in Table 3, if we add the numbers of all suras where the root word "Rashada" occurs, plus the number of verses, we get 1368, or 19x72.

(11) If we write down the sura number, followed by the number of verses per sura, followed by the individual verse numbers, from the ﬁrst occurr- ence of the root word "Rashada" ( 2:186 ) to the last occurrence of "Rashada" ( 72:21 ), and place these numbers next to each other, we get a very long number that consists of 11087 digits, and is a multiple of 19. This very long number begins with the number of Sura 2 , followed by the number of verses in Sura 2 from the ﬁrst occurrence of "Rashada" at verse 186 to the end of the sura (100 verses). Thus, the beginning of the number looks like this: 2 100. The numbers of these 100 individual verses (187 to 286) are placed next to this number. Thus, 
the number representing Sura 2 looks like this: 2 100 187 188 189 ..... 285 286. The same process is 
carried out all the way to 72:21 , the last occurrence of the root "Rashada." The complete number looks like this: 
2 100 187 188 189 ..... 72 21 1 2 3 ..... 19 20 21 
The Sura number is followed by the number of verses, then the numbers of individual verses, from the ﬁrst to the last occurrence of "Rashada" ( 2:187 through 72:21 ). The complete number consists of 11087 digits, and is divisible by 19. 
(12) If we examine the suras and verses from the ﬁrst occurrence of the root word "Rashada" to the word "Khalifa" in 38:26 , we ﬁnd that the sum of sura numbers and their numbers of verses is 4541, or 19x239. The details are in Table 4.

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1286 -----------------------------------------------------
its verses, from the ﬁrst "Rashada" ( 2:186 ) to the word "Khalifa" ( 38:26 ), we get a long number that is divisible by 19. 
The ﬁrst occurrence of "Rashada" is in 2:186 . So, we write down 2 186. The second occurrence is in 2:256 , so we write down 256. The next occurrence is in 4:6 , so we write down 4 6, and so on, until we write down 38 26 ("Khalifa" occurs in 38:26 ). The complete number looks like this: 
505 725 2 186 256 4 6 ............... 38 26 
The gematrical value of "Rashad" is followed by the value of "Khalifa," followed by the sura number and verse numbers of every occurrence of the root word "Rashada" from the ﬁrst occurrence of "Rashada" to the occurrence of "Khalifa" in 38:26 . 
The Only Religion Approved by God is Islam [ 3:19 ] 
(14) The Quran speciﬁes three messengers of Islam (Submission): 
Abraham delivered all the practices of Islam. The value of his name = 258 Muhammad delivered the Quran. The value of his name = 92 Rashad delivered Islam's proof of authenticity. The value of his name = 505 Total gematrical value of the 3 names = 258 + 92 + 505 = 855. (19x45) 
The true Judaism, Christianity, and Islam will be consolidated into one religion - complete submission and absolute devotion to God ALONE. 
The existing religions, including Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are severely corrupted and will simply die out ( 9:33 , 48:28 , 61:9 ). 
(15) Since the Quran sometimes refers to "Abraham, Ismail, and Isaac," it was suggested that Ismail and Isaac should be included. Remarkably, the addition of Ismail and Isaac gave a total that is still a multiple of 19. As shown in Table 5, the new total is 1235, or 19x65. This divisibility by 19 is not possible if any of the 3 names Abraham, Muhammad, or Rashad is omitted.

Why 81: Verse 81 & Sura 81 
(16) God's Messenger of the Covenant is prophesied in Verse 81 of Sura 3 . The addition of the gematrical value of "Rashad" (505), plus the gematrical value of "Khalifa" (725), plus the Verse number (81), produces 505 + 725 + 81 = 1311 = 19x69. 
(17) If we look at Sura 81 , we read about a messenger of God who is powerfully supported and authorized by the Almighty (Verse 19). Thus, Verse 81 of Sura 3 , and Sura 81 , Verse 19 are strongly connected with the name "Rashad Khalifa" 505 + 725 + 81 = 1311 = 19x69 
(18) If we add the sura numbers plus the number of verses from the beginning of the Quran to Verse 3:81 , where the Messenger of the Covenant is prophesied, the total comes to 380, 19x20. These data are in Table 6.

2 286 288 
3 81 84 
6 374 380 
(19x20) 
(19) The gematrical value of Verse 3:81 is 13148, 19x692. This value is obtained by adding the gematrical values of every letter in the verse. 
(20) If we look at that portion of Verse 3:81 which refers speciﬁcally to the messenger of the Covenant: "A messenger will come to you, conﬁrming what you have, ” in Arabic: 
“JAA ’AKUM RASOOLUN MUSADDIQUN LEMAA MA`AKUM ”M 
we ﬁnd that the gematrical value of this key phrase is 836, 19×44. 
"Surely, You Are One of the Messengers" ( 36:3 ) 
(21) I was told most assertively, through the angel Gabriel, that Verse 3 of Sura 36 refers speciﬁcally to me. If we arrange the initialed suras only, starting with Sura 2 , then Sura 3 , then Sura 7 , and so on, we ﬁnd that Sura 36, Ya Seen, occupies position number 19. 
(22) Verse 3 of Sura 36 says, "Surely, you are one of the messengers." The gematrical value of this phrase is 612. By adding this value (612), plus the sura number (36), plus the verse number (3), plus the gematrical value of "Rashad Khalifa" (505+725), we get 36+3+612+505 +725 = 1881 = 19x99. 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1288 -----------------------------------------------------
(23) Sura 36 consists of 83 verses. If we add the sura number (36), plus its number of verses (83), plus the gematrical value of "Rashad Khalifa" (505+725), we get 36+83+505+725 = 1349 = 19x71. 
(24) From 3:81 , where the Messenger of the Covenant is prophesied, to Sura 36 , there are 3330 verses. By adding the value of "Rashad Khalifa" (1230), to this number of verses (3330), we get 505+725+3330 = 4560, 19x240. 
(25) From 3:81 to 36:3 there are 3333 verses. By adding this number to the gematrical value of "Rashad" (505),we get 3333+505 = 3838 = 19x202. 
(26) The number of verses from 1:1 to 36:3 is 3705, 19x195 (Table 7).

(27) The sum of verse numbers of every sura from 1:1 to 36:3 is 257925, 19x13575 (Table 7). 
(28) The sum of sura numbers from Sura 1 to Sura 36 is 666 (Table 7). If we add this sum to the gematrical value of "Rashad Khalifa" (505+725), plus the gematrical value of verse 36:3 "Surely, you are one of the messengers," (612), the total is: 666 + 505 + 725 + 612 = 2508 = 19x132. 
(29) If we add the sum of verse numbers(1+2+3+ ...+n) from the ﬁrst occurrence of the root word "Rashada" ( 2:186 ) to 36:3 (You are one of the messengers) to the total of suras (35), plus the sura numbers themselves, the total is 241395, or 19x12705 (Table 8).

(30) The sum of sura numbers from the the ﬁrst occurrence of the root word "Rashada" to 36:3 is 665, 19x35. Note that these are 35 suras (Table 8). 
O people of the scripture, our messenger has come to you, to clarify things for you, after a long period without messengers. Lest you say, "No preacher or warner has come to us." A preacher and warner has come to you. God is Omnipotent. [ 5:19 ] 
"A Messenger to the People of the Scripture" (Jews, Christians, and 
Muslims) 
(31) Obviously, the number of this verse is 19, the Quran's common denominator discovered by Rashad, and the number of occurrences of "Rashada" in the Quran. 
(32) If we add the value of "Rashad Khalifa" (1230), plus the sura number (5), plus the verse number (19), we get 1230+5+19 = 1254 = 19x66. 
(33) The sum of the sura numbers and the number of verses from the beginning of the Quran to this verse ( 5:19 ) is 703, 19x37. See Table 9.

(19x37) 
(34) Sura 98 , "The Proof," Verse 2, proclaims the advent of God's Messenger of the Covenant for the bene ﬁt of "The People of the Scripture (Jews, Christians, and Muslims)." By adding the gematrical value of "Rashad Khalifa" (505+725) to the sura number (98), plus the verse number (2), we get: 505 + 725 + 98 + 2 = 1330 = 19x70. 
Those who disbelieved among the people of the scripture (Jews, Christians, Muslims), and the idolators, will not believe, despite the profound sign given to them. [ 98:1 ] 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1290 -----------------------------------------------------
A messenger from God, reciting Sacred Scriptures. [ 98:2 ] 
(35) It is noteworthy that the word "Bayyinah," which means "Profound Sign," and is the title of Sura 98 , occurs in the Quran 19 times. This is another mathematical conﬁrmation that the Quran's proof of divine authorship is based on the prime number 19, and that "Rashad Khalifa" is the messenger in 98:2 . 
A Profound Messenger Has Come [ 44:13 ] 
(36) By adding the sura numbers, plus the number of verses in each sura, from the 1:1 to 44:13 , the total comes to 5415, 19x19x15 (Table 10). 
(37) The sum of the sura number (44) plus the number of the verse where the messenger is predicted (13) equals 57, 19x3. See Table 10.

END OF THE WORLD 
(38) God is the only Knower of the future; He knows exactly when this world will end ( 7:187 , 31:34 , 33:63 , 41:47 , 43:85 ). We learn from the Quran that God reveals certain aspects of the future to His chosen messengers. In Appendix 25 , evidence is presented that Rashad Khalifa was blessed with unveiling the End of the World, in accordance with 72:27 . 
(39) The number of verses from the beginning of the Quran to Verse 72:27 is 5472, or 19x72x4. Note that the messenger who is given information about the future in 72:27 , and that this sura contains 4 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1291 -----------------------------------------------------
"Rashada" words ( 72:2 , 10, 14, & 21). By adding the value of "Rashad Khalifa" (1230), plus the sura number (72), plus the numbers of the 4 verses where "Rashada" is mentioned, we get 1230+72+2+10+14+21 = 1349 = 19x71. 
(40) Verse 72:27 begins with the statement:" 
" (Only the Messenger that He chooses). 
This reference to the messenger who is chosen by God to receive news about the future has a gematrical value of 1919. Table 11 presents the data.

HOW TO DISTINGUISH GOD'S MESSENGER FROM A FAKE 
MESSENGER 
The Quran provides straightforward criteria to distinguish the true messengers of God from the false messengers: 
[1] God's messenger advocates the worship of God ALONE, and the abolition of all forms of idol worship. 
[2] God's messenger never asks for a wage for himself. 
[3] God's messenger is given divine, incontrovertible proof of his messengership. 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1292 -----------------------------------------------------
Anyone who claims to be God's messenger, and does not meet the three minimum criteria listed above is a false claimant. 
The most important difference between God's messenger and a fake messenger is that God's messenger is supported by God, while the fake messenger is not: 
* God's messenger is supported by God's invisible soldiers ( 3:124 -126, 9:26 & 40, 33:9 , 37:171 - 173, 48:4 & 7, 74:31 ). 
* God's messenger is supported by God's treasury ( 63:7 -8). 
* God's messenger, as well as the believers, are guaranteed victory and dignity, in this world and forever ( 40:51 & 58:21 ). 
Thus, the truthfulness of God's messenger invariably prevails, while the falsehood of a fake messenger invariably, sooner or later, is exposed. 
PRINCIPAL DUTIES OF GOD'S MESSENGER OF THE 
COVENANT 
As stated in the Quran, 3:81 , God's Messenger of the Covenant shall con ﬁrm all the scriptures, which were delivered by all the prophets, and restore them to their original purity. 
MERCY FROM GOD [ 21:107 ] 
When the believers are faced with a problem, they develop a number of possible solutions, and this invariably leads to considerable bickering, disunity, and disarray. We learn from 2:151 , 3:164 , and 21:107 that it is but mercy from God that He sends to us messengers to provide the ﬁnal solutions to our problems. We learn from 42:51 that God sends His messengers to communicate with us, and to disseminate new information. Hence the strong injunction in 4:65 , 80 to accept, without the slightest hesitation, the teachings delivered to us through God's messengers. 
The following is a list of the principal duties of God's Messenger of the Covenant: 
1. Unveil and proclaim the Quran's mathematical miracle (Appendix 1 ). 
2. Expose and remove the two false verses 9:128-129 from the Quran (Appendix 24 ). 
3. Explain the purpose of our lives; why we are here (Appendix 7 ). 
4. Proclaim one religion for all the people, and point out and purge away all the corruptions afﬂicting Judaism, Christianity, and Islam (Appendices 13 , 15 , 19 ). 
5. Proclaim that Zakat (obligatory charity) is a prerequisite for redemption ( 7:156 ), and explain the correct method of observing Zakat (Appendix 15 ). 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1293 -----------------------------------------------------
6. Unveil the end of the world (Appendix 25 ). 
7. Proclaim that those who die before the age of 40 go to Heaven (Appendix 32 ). 
8. Explain Jesus' death (Appendix 22 ). 
9. Explain the Quran's delivery to, then through Muhammad (Appendix 28 ). 
10. Announce that Muhammad wrote God's revelations (the Quran) with his own hand (Appendix 28 ). 
11. Explain why most believers in God do not make it to Heaven (Appendix 27 ). 
12. Proclaim that God never ordered Abraham to kill his son (Appendix 9 ). 
13. Proclaim the secret of perfect happiness (Introduction). 
14. Establish a criminal justice system (Appendix 37 ).

Appendix  3 
We Made the Quran Easy [ 54:17 ] 
Verse  11:1  informs us that the Quran's Miracle involves [1] the superhuman mathematical design of its physical structure and [2] the simultaneous composition of a literary work of extraordinary excellence. 
One may be able to meet the numerical distribution requirements of a simple mathematical pattern. However, this is invariably accomplished at the expense of the literary quality. The simultaneous control of the literary style and the intricate mathematical distribution of individual letters throughout the Quran (Appendix  1 ) is evident in the fact that the Quran is made easy to memorize, understand, and enjoy. Unlike a human-made book, the Quran is enjoyable to read over and over, in ﬁnitely. 
The title of this Appendix is repeated in Sura  54 , verses 17, 22, 32, and 40. As it turns out, the Quran's Arabic text is composed in such a way as to remind the reader or the memorizer of the next correct expression, or the next verse. God created us and He knows the most ef ﬁcient way for ﬁxing literary materials into our memory. Memorization of the Quran has played a vital role in preserving the original text generation after generation at a time when written books were a rarity. 
Without even realizing it, the person who memorizes the Quran is divinely helped by an intricate literary system as he utters the sounds of the Quranic words. Almost every verse in the Quran contains what I call "Memory Bells." Their function is to remind the reader of what comes next. This system is so vast, I will give only two illustrative examples: 
1. In Sura  2 , Verses 127, 128, and 129 end with two different names of God each. These pairs of names are "Al-Samee` Al-`Aleem (The Hearer, the Omniscient)," "Al-Tawwaab Al-Raheem (The Redeemer, Most Merciful)", 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1295 -----------------------------------------------------
and "Al-`Azeez Al-Hakeem (The Almighty, Most Wise)," respectively. If this were a regular book, one would easily mis-match these six names. Not so in the Quran. Each one of these pairs is preceded in the same verse by a "Memory Bell" that reminds us of the correct pair of names. Thus, Verse 127 talks about Abraham and Ismail raising the foundations of the Ka`abah. The verse ends with the names "Al-Samee` Al-`Aleem." The prominent sounds here are the "S," "M," and " `Ayn." These three letters are prominent in the word "Ismail." We ﬁnd that this word is conspicuously delayed in the sentence, while improving its literary quality. Thus, we ﬁnd that the verse goes like this: "When Abraham raised the foundations of the Ka`abah, together with Ismail ..." Normally, a human writer would say, "When Abraham and Ismail raised the foundations of the Ka`abah...." But delaying the sounds in "Ismail" brings them closer to the end of the verse, and thus reminds us that the correct names of God in this verse are "Al-Samee` Al- `Aleem." 
Verse 128 has the prominent word "Tubb" just before the names "Al- Tawwaab Al-Raheem." The word "Tubb" thus serves as the memory bell. The names of God at the end of  2:129  are "Azeez, Hakeem." The prominent sounds here are "Z" and "K." Obviously, the memory bell in this verse is the word "Yuzakkeehim." 
2. Another good example is found in  3:176 , 177, & 178, where the retribution for disbelievers is described as " `Azeem (Terrible)," "Aleem (Painful)," and "Muheen (Humiliating)," respectively. In a human-made book, the memorizer could easily mix up these three descriptions. But we ﬁnd that each of these adjectives is preceded by powerful memory bells that prevent such a mix-up. The word " `Azeem" of Verse 176 is preceded by the word "Huzzun," which is characterized by a stressed letter "Z." This serves to remind us of the particular adjective at the end of this verse. The word "Aleem" of Verse 177 is preceded by the sound of the word "Iman" to serve as a memory bell, and the word "Muheen" of  3:178  is preceded by an abundance of "M" and "H" throughout this verse. 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1296 -----------------------------------------------------
Other examples of memory bells include the ending of  3:173   and the beginning of  3:174 , the ending of  4:52   and the beginning of  4:53 , the ending of  4:61   and the beginning of  4:62 , the ending of  18:53   and the beginning of  18:54 , and many more. 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1297 -----------------------------------------------------
Appendix  4 
Why Was the Quran Revealed in 
Arabic? 
We learn from  41:44   that the sincere believers have access to the Quran, regardless of their mother tongue. The disbelievers, on the other hand, are not permitted access to the Quran, even if they are professors of the Arabic language ( 17:45 ,  18:57 ,  41:44 , &  56:79 ). 
Arabic is the most efﬁcient language in the world, especially when it comes to the precise statement of laws. Since the Quran is a Statute Book, it was crucial that such laws must be clearly stated. God chose Arabic for His Final Testament because of the obvious reason that it is the most suitable language for that purpose. Arabic is unique in its efﬁciency and accuracy. For example, the word "they" in English does not tell you if "they" are males or females. In Arabic there is a "they" for the males, "HUM," and a "they" for the females, "HUNNA." There is even a "they" for two males, "HUMAA," and a "they" for two females, "HAATAAN." This feature does not exist in any other language in the world. I came to appreciate this efﬁciency of the Arabic language when I translated, for example,  2:228 . This verse enjoins the divorcee to give up her own wishes to divorce her husband, if she discovers that she is pregnant, and the husband wishes to reconcile - the welfare of the child takes a priority. The efﬁciency of the Arabic language was extremely helpful in stating this law. Any other language would have made it almost impossible to point out whose wishes are to be superseded, at least not in such a few words as we see in  2:228 . 
The word "Qaalataa" of  28:23 , for example, translates into four English words: "the two women said." Such is the efﬁciency of the Arabic language. 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1298 -----------------------------------------------------
Another possible reason for choosing Arabic is the fact that "He" and "She" do not necessarily imply natural gender. Thus, when God is referred to as "He," this does not imply gender at all. God be glori ﬁed; He is neither male, nor female. The usage of "He" to refer to God in the English language, for example, has contributed to a false image of God. This was not helped by such distorted expressions as "Father" when referring to God. You never ﬁnd such a reference to God in the Quran. 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1299 -----------------------------------------------------
Appendix 5 
Heaven and Hell 
The descriptions of Heaven and Hell throughout the Quran are allegorical. And the Quran tells us so whenever such descriptions occur as independent statements, not within a general subject. See 2:24 -26, 13:35 , and 47:15 . The word "Mathal" (allegory) is used in these verses. Linguistically, the word "Mathal" in these verses can be removed, and we still have perfect sentences. But it is there because the descriptions of Heaven and Hell are allegorical. 
What Heaven and Hell are really like is far beyond our comprehension. Hence the need for allegory. 
How can one describe, for example, the taste of chocolate to a person who never tasted chocolate? Allegory will have to be used. The person has to wait to actually taste chocolate in order to know what chocolate tastes like. Whatever allegory we use to describe the taste of chocolate can never approximate the real thing. 
Heaven already exists, since Adam and Eve were placed in it during their days of innocence ( 2:35 ). We learn from Sura 55 that there are two "High Heavens" - one for the humans and one for the jinns - and two "Lower Heavens" - one for the humans and one for the jinns (see Appendix 11 for more details). 
Hell is not created yet. It will be created on the Day of Judgment ( 69:17 & 89:23 ). More details are given in Appendix 11 . 
The High Heaven vs The Lower Heaven 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1300 -----------------------------------------------------
There are profound differences between the High Heaven and the Lower Heaven. Allegorically, water in the High Heaven ﬂows freely ( 55:50 ), while the water of the Lower Heaven needs to be pumped out ( 55:66 ). 
Allegorically, the High Heaven has all kinds of fruit ( 55:52 ), while the Lower Heaven has a limited variety of fruits ( 55:68 ). 
Allegorically, the pure spouses readily join their spouses in the High Heaven ( 55:56 ), while the dwellers of the Lower Heaven must go fetch their spouses ( 55:72 ). 
Yet, even the Lower Heaven is an incredibly fantastic prize for those who are fortunate enough to escape Hell and end up in the Lower Heaven ( 3:185 ) - going to the Lower Heaven is a great triumph. People who depart this life before reaching their 40th birthday, and did not sufﬁciently develop their souls, will go to the Lower Heaven ( 46:15 , Appendices 11 & 32 ). The High Heaven is reserved for those who believed, led a righteous life, and developed their souls suf ﬁciently. 
Whoever succeeds in barely missing Hell, and is admitted into Heaven, has attained a great triumph. [ 3:185 ] 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1301 -----------------------------------------------------
Appendix  6 
Greatness of God 
We learn from Verse  39:67   that God's greatness is far beyond human comprehension - the verse states that all seven universes are "folded within God's hand." 
Supported by the Quran's formidable mathematical code, we are taught that our universe is the smallest and innermost of seven universes ( 41:12 ,  55:33 ,  67:5 , &  72:8 -12). Meanwhile, our scientiﬁc advances have shown us that our galaxy, the Milky Way, is 100,000 light years across, and that our universe contains a billion such galaxies and a billion trillion stars, plus countless decillions of heavenly bodies. Our universe is estimated to span distances in excess of 20,000,000,000 light years. 
Count the Stars! 
If we take only a quintillion [1,000,000,000,000,000,000] of the stars and simply count them [from 0 to quintillion] one count per second, day and night, this will take 32 billion years (more than the age of the universe). That is how long it will take to just "count" them; but God "created" them. Such is the greatness of God. 
We can appreciate the vastness of our universe if we imagine going on a space odyssey. When we leave the planet Earth towards the sun, at the speed of light, we reach the sun after 93,000,000 miles and 8 minutes. It will take us more than 50,000 years at the speed of light to exit our galaxy. From the outer limit of the Milky Way, our planet Earth is invisible. Not even the most powerful telescope can detect our tiny "Earth." 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1302 -----------------------------------------------------
We have to spend more than 2,000,000 years at the speed of light to reach our next-door galaxy. At least 10,000,000,000 years, at the speed of light, must be spent to reach the outer limit of our universe. From the outer limit of our universe, even the Milky Way is like a speck of dust in a large room. 
The second universe surrounds our universe. The third universe is larger than the second, and so on. More accurately, our universe should be considered the seventh universe, surrounded by the sixth universe, which is surrounded by the ﬁfth universe, and so on. Can you imagine the vastness of the ﬁrst, outermost universe? No number exists to describe the circumference of the ﬁrst universe. This incomprehensible vastness is "within the ﬁst of God's hand." From the outer limit of the outermost universe, where is the planet Earth? How signiﬁcant is it? On the inﬁnitesimal mote called Earth, such minuscule creatures as Mary, Jesus, and Muhammad lived. Yet, some people set up these powerless humans as gods! 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1303 -----------------------------------------------------
God's greatness is represented not only by the fact that He holds the seven universes in His hand, but also by the fact that He fully controls every atom, even subatomic components, everywhere in the greater universe ( 6:59 ,  10:61 , &  34:3 ).

The horn is blown, whereupon everyone in the heavens and the earth is struck unconscious, except those spared by God. Then it is blown a second time, whereupon they rise up. [ 39:68 ] 
All generations of humans and jinns will be resurrected on this earth; about 150 billion of them. But we will not be earthbound. God teaches us through the example of the caterpillar; it turns into a pupa in the cocoon (grave), then exits the cocoon as an airborne butter ﬂy. Similarly, we live here on earth, and when we exit the grave on the Day of Resurrection we will not be earthbound; like the butterﬂy ( 101:4 ). 
The earth will shine with the light of God ( 39:69 ) as He comes to our universe, together with the angels ( 89:22 ). Since our universe is a temporary dominion for Satan, it cannot stand the physical presence of God ( 7:143 ). As the Almighty approaches, the stars will crash into one another ( 77:8 , 81:2 ), and the earth will shatter under our feet ( 69:14 , 89:21 ). These horrors will not worry the believers ( 21:103 ). 
The High Heaven 
Upon arrival of Almighty God, all the humans and jinns will be automatically stratiﬁed according to their degree of growth and development. Those who nourished their souls through worshiping God alone, believing in the Hereafter, and leading a righteous life will be strong enough to stay close to God; they will occupy the highest ranks (see Appendix 5 ). 
The Lower Heaven 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1305 -----------------------------------------------------
Those who developed their souls to a lesser degree, as well as those who die before the age of forty, will move downward to the Lower Heaven. They will go to the location where they can be as close to God as their degree of growth and development permits them to be. 
The Purgatory 
There will be people who nourished their souls just enough to spare them Hell, but not enough to enter the Lower Heaven. They are neither in Hell, nor in Heaven. They will implore God to admit them into the Lower Heaven ( 7:46 -50). God will have mercy on them, and will merge the Purgatory into the Lower Heaven. 
Hell 
A new, eighth universe will be created to house those who run away from God due to their weakness; they failed to nourish and develop their souls ( 69:17 ). God does not put a single being in Hell; they go to it on their own volition (Appendix 5 ).

Appendix  8 
The Myth of Intercession 
To believe that anyone, other than God, can intercede on our behalf to have our sins forgiven or our wishes ful ﬁlled, is to set up partners with God. This is idolatry. The Quran proclaims that "All intercession belongs to God" ( 39:44 ), and that there will be "no intercession on the Day of Judgment" ( 2:254 ). 
The myth of intercession is one of Satan's most effective tricks to dupe millions of people into idol worship. Millions of Christians believe that Jesus will intercede for them at God, and millions of Muslims believe that Muhammad will intercede on their behalf. Consequently, these people idolize Jesus and Muhammad. 
The concept of intercession is utterly illogical. Those who believe in Muhammad's intercession, for example, claim that he will ask God to forgive them and admit them into Paradise. They imagine Muhammad on the Day of Judgment choosing the candidates for his intercession. If you ask those who believe in intercession: "How will Muhammad recognize those who deserve his intercession?" they tell you, "God will tell him!" According to this concept, a person will go to Muhammad and request his intercession. Muhammad will then ask God whether this person deserves his intercession or not. God will inform Muhammad that the person deserves to go to Paradise. Muhammad will then turn around and tell God that the person deserves to go to Paradise! The blasphemy is obvious; those who believe in intercession make God a secretary of their idol Muhammad. God be glori ﬁed. 
Since the Quran is the most accurate book, it acknowledges that everyone in Paradise will intercede on behalf of his or her loved ones: "Please God, admit my mother into Paradise." This intercession will work if the person's 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1307 -----------------------------------------------------
mother deserves to go to Paradise ( 2:255 ,  20:109 ,  21:28 ). Thus, intercession, though it will take place in this manner, is utterly useless. 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1308 -----------------------------------------------------
We learn from the Quran that Abraham, God's beloved servant, could not intercede on behalf of his father ( 9:114 ). Noah could not intercede on behalf of his son ( 11:46 ). Muhammad could not intercede on behalf of his uncle ( 111:1 -3) or relatives ( 9:80 ). What makes anyone think that a prophet or a saint will intercede on behalf of a perfect stranger?! See  2:48 , 123;   6:51 , 70, 94;   7:53 ;   10:3 ;   19:87 ;   26:100 ;   30:13 ;   32:4 ; 36:23 ;  39:44 ;  40:18 ;  43:86 ;  53:26   &  74:48 . Muhammad's intercession is in  25:30 .

Appendix  9 
Abraham: Original Messenger of 
Islam 
One of the prevalent myths is that Muhammad was the founder of Islam. Although Islam, total submission to God alone, is the only religion recognized by God since the time of Adam ( 3:19 , 85), Abraham is reported in the Quran as the ﬁrst user of the word "Islam" and the one who called us "Muslims" ( 22:78 ). Abraham's exemplary submission to God is demonstrated by his famous willingness to sacriﬁce his only son, Ismail, when he thought that that was God's command. As it turns out, such a command was in fact from Satan. 
God Never Ordered Abraham to Sacriﬁce His Son 
God is the Most Merciful. He never violates His own law ( 7:28 ). Any person who believes that the Most Merciful ordered Abraham to kill his son cannot possibly make it to God's Heaven. Such evil thought about God is grossly blasphemous. Nowhere in the Quran do we see that God ordered Abraham to kill his son. On the contrary, God intervened to save Abraham and Ismail from Satan's plot ( 37:107 ), and He told Abraham: "You believed the dream" ( 37:105 ). Undoubtedly, it was a dream inspired by Satan. God's irrevocable law is: "God never advocates sin" ( 7:28 ) 
Millat Ibrahim 
Islam is called "Millat Ibrahim" (The Religion of Abraham) throughout the Quran ( 2:130 , 135;  3:95 ;  4:125 ;  6:161 ;  12:37 -38;  16:123 ;  21:73 ;  22:78 ). Moreover, the Quran informs us that Muhammad was a follower of Abraham ( 16:123 ). 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1310 -----------------------------------------------------
Due to a general unawareness of the fact that Abraham was the original messenger of Islam, many so-called Muslims challenge God: "If the Quran is complete and fully detailed (as claimed by God), where can we ﬁnd the number of Rak`ahs (units) in each contact prayer (Salat)?" We learn from the Quran that all religious practices of Islam were already established before the Quran's revelation ( 8:35 ,  9:54 ,  16:123 ,  21:73 ,  22:27 ,  28:27 ). Verse  16:123  is direct proof that all religious practices in Islam were intact when Muhammad was born. Muhammad was enjoined to "follow the religion of Abraham." If I ask you to buy a color TV, it is assumed that you know what a color TV is. Similarly, when God enjoined Muhammad to follow the practices of Abraham ( 16:123 ), such practices must have been well known. 
Another proof of divine preservation of the Islamic practices given to Abraham is the "Universal Acceptance" of such practices. There is no dispute concerning the number of Rak`ahs in all ﬁve daily prayers. This proves the divine preservation of Salat. The Quran's mathematical code conﬁrms the number of Rak`ahs in the ﬁve prayers 2, 4, 4, 3, and 4, respectively. The number 24434 is a multiple of 19. 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1311 -----------------------------------------------------
The Quran deals only with practices that were distorted. For example, the distorted ablution is restored in  5:6   to its original four steps. The tone of voice during the contact prayers (Salat) was distorted - many Muslims pray silently. This was corrected in the Quran,  17:110 . The fasting during Ramadan was modiﬁed in the Quran to allow intercourse during the night ( 2:187 ). Zakat is restored in  6:141 , and Hajj is restored to the four correct months (see Appendix  15 ).

Appendix  10 
God's Usage of the Plural Tense 
In the English speaking world, where the trinity doctrine is prevalent, some people are intrigued by God's usage of the plural tense in the Quran. The overwhelming message of the Quran, where there is absolutely no compromise is that "GOD IS ONE" ( 2:133 ,  163;  4:171 ;  5:73 ;  6:19 ;  9:31 ;  12:39 ;  13:16 ;  14:48 , 52;  16:22 ,  51;  18:110 ;   21:108 ;    22:34 ;  37:4 ;  38:65 ;  39:4 ;   40:16 ;  41:6 ;  112:1 ). 
Whenever the ﬁrst person plural form is used by the Almighty, it invariably indicates participation of other entities, such as the angels. For example, the revelation of this Quran involved participation of the angel Gabriel and the prophet Muhammad. Hence the use of the plural form in  15:9 : "We revealed this scripture, and we will preserve it." The plural form here simply reﬂects the fact that the angel Gabriel and the prophet Muhammad participated in the process of delivering the Quran. 
Another example has to do with blowing the breath of life into Adam and Jesus. The creation of Adam took place in heaven and God directly blew into him the breath of life. Thus, the ﬁrst person singular form is consistently used: "I blew into Adam from My spirit" ( 15:29 ,  38:72 ). The creation of Jesus, on the other hand, took place on earth, and Gabriel carried God's "word" to Mary. The plural form is consistently used when referring to the creation of Jesus ( 21:91 ,  66:12 ). 
When God spoke to Moses directly, without the mediation of angels, we see that God is speaking exclusively in the singular tense: "I am God. There is no other god besides Me. You shall worship Me alone, and observe the regular contact prayers (Salat) to commemorate Me." ( 20:12 -14). 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1313 -----------------------------------------------------
Whenever the worship of God is mentioned, the singular tense is used ( 51:56 ).

A new, eighth universe will be created to house those who run away from God due to their weakness; they failed to nourish and develop their souls ( 69:17 ). God does not put a single being in Hell; they go to it on their own volition (Appendix 5 ).

Appendix 12 
Role of the Prophet Muhammad 
The Prophet's sole mission was to deliver Quran, the whole Quran, and nothing but Quran ( 3:20 ; 5:48 -50, 92, 99; 6:19 ; 13:40 ; 16:35 , 82; 24:54 ; 29:18 ; 42:48 ; 64:12 ). 
Delivering the Quran was such a momentous and noble mission that the Prophet did not have any time to do anything else. Moreover, the Prophet was enjoined in the strongest words from issuing any religious teachings besides the Quran ( 69:38 -47). He was even enjoined from explaining the Quran ( 75:15 -19) - God is the only teacher of the Quran ( 55:1 -2) and the Quran is the best Hadith ( 39:23 & 45:6 ). 
These Quranic facts are manifested in the historical reality that the words and actions (Hadith & Sunna) attributed to the Prophet did not appear until the second century after his death. The Quran has prophesied the fabrication of Hadith and Sunna by the Prophet's enemies ( 6:112 -115). The Quran teaches us that it was God's will to permit the invention of Hadith and Sunna to serve as criteria for exposing those who believe only with their lips, not in their hearts. Those who are attracted to Hadith and Sunna are proven to be false believers ( 6:113 ). Ironically, the books of Hadith report the Prophet's orders to write down nothing from him except the Quran! Shown below are two such Hadiths taken from the Hadithists' most reliable sources, Sahih Muslim and Is-haah Ahmad Ibn Hanbal: 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1317 -----------------------------------------------------
The Prophet said, "Do not write down anything from me except the Quran." [Ahmed, Vol. 1, Page 171, and Sahih Muslim] 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1318 -----------------------------------------------------
This Hadith states that the Prophet maintained his anti-Hadith stand until death. [Ahmed, Vol. 1, Page 192]

Appendix 13 
The First Pillar of Islam (Submission): 
"Laa Elaaha Ellaa Allah" (No god except God) 
Verse 3:18 states the First Pillar of Islam (Submission): "God bears witness that there is no other god besides Him, and so do the angels and those who possess knowledge." 
This most crucial pillar has been distorted. Millions of Muslims have adopted Satan's polytheistic version, and insist upon mentioning the name of Muhammad besides the name of God. However, the Quran's great criterion in 39:45 stamps such Muslims as disbelievers: "When God ALONE is mentioned, the hearts of those who do disbelieve in the Hereafter shrink with aversion, but when others are mentioned with Him, they become satis ﬁed." 
I have conducted extensive research into this criterion, and I have reached a startling conclusion: the idol worshipers who do not uphold the First Pillar of Islam as dictated in 3:18 are forbidden by God from uttering the correct Shahadah. They simply cannot say: "Ash-hadu Allaa Elaaha Ellaa Allah" by itself, without mentioning the name of Muhammad. Try it with any idol worshiper who claims to be a Muslim. Challenge them to say: "Ash-hadu Allaa Elaaha Ellaa Allah." They can never say it. Since this is the religion of Abraham ( 2:130 , 135; 3:95 ; 4:125 ; 6:161 ; 12:37 -38; 16:123 ; 22:78 ; Appendix 9 ), the ONLY creed must be "LAA ELAAHA ELLAA ALLAH (there is no god except the One God)". Muhammad did not exist on earth before Abraham. 
A Gross Blasphemy 
There is no greater blasphemy than distorting the Quran to idolize the prophet Muhammad against his will. Verse 19 of Sura "Muhammad" ( 47:19 ) states: "You shall know that there is no god except the one God." 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1320 -----------------------------------------------------
Shown below is a photocopy of the regular logo of a Muslim publication THE REVIEW OF RELIGIONS (The London Mosque, 16 Gressenhall Road, London SW18 5QL, England.) Using the Quran's calligraphic style, the publishers of THE REVIEW OF RELIGIONS added the phrase "Muhammad Rasool Allah" in such a way that gives a false impression that such is the Quranic statement of 47:19 . What a blasphemy! 
You shall know that there is no god besides the One God, Allah. Muhammad is a messenger of God.

Typical Example of the Distorted Islam

Appendix  14 
Predestination 
We are absolutely free to believe or disbelieve in God. It is God's will that we will ( 18:29 ,  25:57 ,  73:19 ,  74:37 ,  76:29 ,  78:39 ,  80:12 ). 
After committing our original sin (Appendix  7 ), God gave us a chance to denounce our crime and accept His absolute authority ( 33:72 ). But we decided that we wanted to see a demonstration of Satan's competence as a god. Many people protest the fact that God has created them, to put them through this gruesome test. Obviously, such people are not aware that [1] they have committed a horrendous crime (Introduction & Appendix  7 ), and [2] that they were given a chance to denounce their crime and redeem themselves, but they chose to go through the test. 
We learn from  57:22   that our lives, along with everything else around us, are pre-recorded on something like a videotape. God fully knows what kind of decision each of us is destined to make; He knows which of us are going to Heaven and which are going to Hell. Even before we were born into this world, God knew which souls are good and which souls are evil. As far as God's omniscience is concerned, we can imagine a stamp on everyone's forehead that says "Heaven" or "Hell." Yet, as far as we are concerned, we are totally free to side with God's absolute authority, or Satan's polytheistic views. Predestination, therefore, is a fact as far as God is concerned, not as far as we are concerned. 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1323 -----------------------------------------------------
This understanding explains the numerous verses stating that "God guides whomever He wills, and misleads whomever He wills." Based on His knowledge, God assigns our souls to the circumstances that we deserve. When God said to the angels, "I know what you do not know" ( 2:30 ), this meant that some of us deserved a chance to redeem ourselves. One example of God's guidance for those who deserve guidance is found in  21:51 : "We granted Abraham his guidance, for we were fully aware of him." In other words, God knew that Abraham was a good soul who deserved to be guided, and God granted him his guidance and understanding. Another good example is stated in  12:24 . Joseph fell for the Egyptian nobleman's wife, and almost committed adultery "if it were not that he saw a sign from his Lord." God teaches us in  12:24   that He "diverted evil and sin from Joseph, for he was one of My devoted worshipers." Was it Joseph who controlled his lust? Or, was it God's protection from sin that rendered him chaste? Such is predestination. 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1324 -----------------------------------------------------
Appendix 15 
Religious Duties: A Gift From God 
When Abraham implored God in 14:40, he did not ask for wealth or health; the gift he implored for was: "Please God, make me one who observes the contact prayers (Salat)." The religious duties instituted by God are in fact a great gift from Him. They constitute the nourishment required for the growth and development of our Souls. Without such nourishment, we cannot survive the immense energy associated with God's physical presence on the Day of Judgment. Belief in God does not by itself guarantee our redemption; we must also nourish our souls ( 6:158 , 10:90 -92). Additionally, 15:99 states that observing the religious duties instituted by God is our means of attaining certainty: "Worship your Lord in order to attain certainty." 
The Contact Prayers (Salat) 
The ﬁve daily contact prayers are the main meals for the soul. While a soul may attain some growth and development by leading a righteous life, and without observing the contact prayers, this would be like surviving on snacks without regular meals. 
We learn from 2:37 that we can establish contact with God by uttering the speciﬁc Arabic words given to us by God. Sura 1 , The Key, is a mathematically composed combination of sounds that unlocks the door between us and God: 
1. The Dawn Prayer must be observed during two hours before sunrise ( 11:114 , 24:58 ). 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1325 -----------------------------------------------------
2. The Noon Prayer is due when the sun declines from its highest point at noon ( 17:78 ). 
3. The Afternoon Prayer can be observed during the 3-4 hours preceding sunset ( 2:238 ). 
4. The Sunset Prayer becomes due after sunset ( 11:114 ). 
5. The Night Prayer can be observed after the twilight disappears from the sky ( 24:58 ). * The Friday noon congregational prayer is an obligatory duty upon every Submitting man and woman ( 62:9 ). Failure to observe the Friday Prayer is a gross offense. 
Each contact prayer is valid if observed anytime during the period it becomes due until the next prayer becomes due. Once missed, a given contact prayer is a missed opportunity that cannot be made up; one can only repent and ask forgiveness. The ﬁve prayers consist of 2, 4, 4, 3, and 4 units (Rak'ahs), respectively. 
The proof that Salat was already established through Abraham is found in 8:35 , 9:54 , 16:123 , & 21:73 . This most important duty in Islam (Submission) has been so severely distorted that the contact prayers (Salat) have become a practice in idolatry for the vast majority of Muslims. Although the Quran commands that our contact prayers must be devoted to God alone ( 20:14 ; 39:3 , 45), today's Muslims insist on commemorating "Muhammad and his family" and "Abraham and his family" during their prayers. This renders the prayers null and void ( 39:65 ). 
The following text, pertaining to the miracles conﬁrming the contact prayers, is excerpted from the January 1990 issues of the Submitter's Perspective (the regular and special bonus issues), as written by Dr. Rashad Khalifa: 
AWESOME MATHEMATICAL 
MIRACLE CONFIRMS ALL THE 
5 CONTACT PRAYERS 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1326 -----------------------------------------------------
[1] Sura 1 is God's gift to us, to establish contact with Him (Salat). Write the sura number and the number of verses next to each other and you get 17, the total number of units in the 5 daily prayers. 
[2] Let us write down the sura number, followed by the number of every verse in the sura. This is what we get: 
1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 . This number is a multiple of 19. 
Properties of Sura 1 , The Key 
Verse No. No. of Letters Gematrical Value 
1 19 786 
2 17 581 
3 12 618 
4 11 241 
5 19 836 
6 18 1072 
7 43 6009 
[3] Now, let us replace each verse number by the number of letters in that verse. This is what we get: 1 19 17 12 11 19 18 43 also a multiple of 19. Theoretically, one can alter the letters of Sura 1 , and still keep the same number of letters, however, the following mathematical phenomena rule out that possibility. For the gematrical value of every single letter is taken into consideration. Here it is: 
[4] Let us include the gematrical value of every verse, and write it down following the number of letters in each verse: 1 19 786 17 581 12 618 11 241 19 836 18 1072 43 6009 also a multiple of 19. 
[5] Now, let us add the number of each verse, to be followed by the number of letters in that verse, then the gematrical value of that verse. This is what we get: 1 1 19 786 2 17 581 3 12 618 4 11 241 5 19 836 6 18 1072 7 43 6009 a multiple of 19. 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1327 -----------------------------------------------------
[6] Instead of the gematrical value of every verse, let us write down the gematrical values of every individual letter in Sura 1 . This truly awesome miracle, shows that the resulting long number, consisting of 274 digits, is also a multiple of 19. ALLAHU AKBAR. 1 7 1 19 2 60 40 1 30 30 5 1 30 200 8 40 50 1 30 200 8 10 40 2 17 ... 50 
This number starts with the sura number, followed by the number of verses in the sura, followed by the verse number, followed by the number of letters in this verse, followed by the gematrical values of every letter in this verse, followed by the number of the next verse, followed by the number of letters in this verse, followed by the gematrical values of every letter in this verse, and so on to the end of the sura. Thus, the last component is 50, the value of "N" (last letter). 
[7] Since I cannot write very long numbers here, let us substitute [*] for the long number consisting of the number of every verse, followed by the number of letters in the verse, followed by the gematrical value of every individual letter in the verse. If we write down the number of the sura, followed by its number of verses, we get 17, the number of units (Rak'aas) in the 5 daily prayers. Next to the 17, write down the number of the ﬁrst prayer (1), followed by its number of Rak'aas, which is 2, then two [*]'s, followed by the number of the second prayer (2), followed by the number of Rak'aas in the second prayer (4), followed by four [*]'s, and so on. Not only is the resulting long number a multiple of 19, but also the number of its component digits is 4636 (19x244) .... Please note that any representation of Sura 1 can replace the [*]'s without affecting the outcome; all of them give multiples of 19. For example, a short representation of "The Key" consists of the Sura number (1), followed by the verses (7), followed by the total number of letters in Sura 1 (139), followed by the total gematrical value of the whole sura (10143). The resulting number (1713910143) can also represent [*].

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1328 -----------------------------------------------------
CONFIRMATION OF FRIDAY 
PRAYERS 
[8] Since the Friday prayer consists of two sermons and two Rak'aas (total is still 4 units), we read only 15 "Keys" on Friday, compared with 17 on the other days. Abdullah Arik discovered that if we replace the 17 by 15 in the long number in [7] and remove two "Keys" from the noon prayer, we still get a multiple of 19. This conﬁrms the Friday Prayer, at noon, with 2 "Keys." The long number shown below represents Friday's ﬁve prayers; it is a multiple of 19.

"THE KEY" (Al-Fateha) MUST 
BE RECITED IN ARABIC 
[9] The ﬁrst sura in the Quran is mathematically composed in a manner that challenges and stumps the greatest mathematicians on earth. Now we appreciate the fact that when we recite Sura 1 , "The Key," during our Contact Prayers, something happens in the universe, and we establish contact with our Creator. The result is perfect happiness, now and forever. By contacting our Almighty Creator 5 times a day, we nourish and develop our souls in preparation for the Big Day when we meet God. Only those who nourish their souls will be able to withstand and enjoy the physical presence of Almighty God. 
All submitters, of all nationalities, recite the words of "The Key" which were written by God Himself, and given to us to establish contact with Him ( 2:37 ). 
Edip Yuksel's discovery adds to the awesomeness of "The Key" and proclaims clearly that it must be recited in Arabic.

When you recite "The Key" in Arabic, your lips touch each other precisely 19 times. 
Your lips touch each other where the letters "B" and "M" occur. There are 4 "B's" and 15 "M's" and this adds up to 19. The gematrical value of the 4 "B's" is 4x2=8, and the gematrical value of the 15 "M's" is 15x40=600. The total gematrical value of the 4 "B's" and 15 "M's" is 608, that is 19x32.

CONFIRMATION OF THE 5 
DAILY PRAYERS, NUMBER OF 
BOWINGS (Ruku'), 
PROSTRATIONS (Sujood), AND 
TASHAHHUD 
[10] One of the common challenges...is: "If the Quran is complete and fully detailed (as claimed in 6:19 , 38 & 114), where are the details of the Contact Prayers (Salat)?" These people ask this question because they are not aware that the Quran informs us that the Contact Prayers came from Abraham ( 21:73 & 22:78 ). If we write down the numbers of the prayers with their bowings, prostrations and Tashahhuds, we get: 
1 1 2 2 4 1 2 4 4 8 2 3 4 4 8 2 4 3 3 6 2 5 4 4 8 2 
This long number consists of the sura that we recite in the 5 prayers (1) followed by the number of the ﬁrst prayer (1), then the number of "Keys" that we recite in this prayer (2), then the number of bowings (Ruku`) (2), then the number of prostrations (4), then the number of Tashahhuds (in the sitting position) (1), then the number of the second prayer (2), then the number of "Keys" that we recite in the second prayer (4), then the number of bowings (Ruku`) in this prayer (4), then the number of prostrations (8), then the number of Tashahhuds (2), then the number of the third prayer (3), and so on to the last prayer. This long number is a multiple of 19, and this conﬁrms the minutest details of the prayers, even in the number of Ruku`, Sujud, and Tashahhud. 
The Obligatory Charity (Zakat) 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1331 -----------------------------------------------------
Zakat must be given away "on the day of harvest" ( 6:141 ). Whenever we receive "net income," we must set aside 2.5% and give it to the speciﬁed recipients - the parents, relatives, orphans, the poor, and the traveling alien, in this order ( 2:215 ). The vital importance of Zakat is reﬂected in God's law: "My mercy encompasses all things, but I will specify it for the righteous who give Zakat" ( 7:156 ). 
Zakat must be carefully calculated and given away on a regular basis whenever we receive any income. Government taxes should be deducted, but not other expenses such as debts, mortgages, and living expenses. If one does not know needy persons, he or she may give the Zakat to a mosque or charitable organization with the distinct purpose of helping poor people. Charities given to mosques or hospitals or organizations cannot be considered Zakat. 
Fasting 
The full details of fasting are given in 2:183 -187. 
Pilgrimage: Hajj & `Umrah 
Once in a lifetime, Hajj and `Umrah are decreed for those who can afford it. Pilgrimage commemorates Abraham's exemplary submission to God (Appendix 9), and must be observed during the four Sacred Months - Zul- Hijjah, Muharram, Safar, & Rabi` I (12th, 1st, 2nd, 3rd months) ( 2:197 ; 9:2 , 36 ). `Umrah can be observed any time. Like all other duties in Islam, Hajj has been distorted. Most Muslims observe Hajj only during a few days in Zul-Hijjah, and they consider Rajab, Zul-Qi'dah, Zul-Hijjah, and Muharram (7th, 11th, 12th, 1st months) to be the Sacred Months. This is a distortion that is strongly condemned ( 9:37 ). 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1332 -----------------------------------------------------
The pilgrimage begins with a bath or shower, followed by a state of sanctity called "Ihraam," where the male pilgrim wears seamless sheets of material, and the woman wears a modest dress ( 2:196 ). Throughout Hajj, the pilgrim abstains from sexual intercourse, vanities such as shaving and cutting the hair, arguments, misconduct, and bad language ( 2:197 ). Cleanliness, bathing, and regular hygiene practices are encouraged. Upon arrival at the Sacred Mosque in Mecca, the pilgrim walks around the Ka`bah seven times, while glorifying and praising God ( 2:125 , 22:26 -29). The common formula is: "Labbayka Allaahumma Labbayk" (My God, I have responded to You). "Labbayka Laa Shareeka Laka Labbayk" (I have responded to You, and I proclaim that there is no other god besides You; I have responded to You). The next step is to walk the half-mile distance between the knolls of Safa and Marwah seven times, with occasional trotting ( 2:158 ). This completes the `Umrah portion of the pilgrimage. 
The pilgrim then goes to `Arafat to spend a day of worship, meditation, and gloriﬁcation of God, from dawn to sunset ( 2:198 ). After sunset, the pilgrim goes to Muzdalifah where the Night Prayer is observed, and 21 pebbles are picked up for the symbolic stoning of Satan at Mina. From Muzdalifah, the pilgrim goes to Mina to spend two or three days ( 2:203 ). On the ﬁrst morning at Mina, the pilgrim offers an animal sacriﬁce to feed the poor and to commemorate God's intervention to save Ismail and Abraham from Satan's trick ( 37:107 , Appendix 9 ). The stoning ceremonies symbolize rejection of Satan's polytheism and are done by throwing seven pebbles at each of three stations, while glorifying God ( 15:34 ). The pilgrim then returns to Mecca and observes a farewell circumvolution of the Ka`bah seven times. 
Unfortunately, most of today's Muslim pilgrims make it a custom to visit the prophet Muhammad's tomb where they commit the most ﬂagrant acts of idolatry and thus nullify their Hajj. The Quran consistently talks about "The Sacred Mosque," while today's Muslims talk about "The Two Sacred Mosques!" In a glaring act of idolatry, the Muslims have set up Muhammad's tomb as another "Sacred Mosque!" This is a blasphemous violation of the Quran, and, ironically, even violates Hadith. The Hadith shown below illustrates this strange irony:

Translation of this false statement: "God has cursed the Jews and Christians for turning the tombs of their prophets into mosques." 
[Bukhari, Nawawi Edition, Vol. 6, Page 14] 
Physical Beneﬁts 
In addition to their invaluable spiritual bene ﬁts, there is a plethora of physical, economic, and health beneﬁts from observing the contact prayers (Salat), obligatory charity (Zakat), fasting during the month of Ramadan, and Hajj. 
Observing the Dawn prayer interrupts long periods of stillness during sleep; this is now proven to help prevent arthritis. Also, getting up early in the morning helps combat depression and other psychological problems. The prostration position which is repeated during the contact prayers expands the blood vessels in our brains to accommodate more blood, and this prevents headaches. The repeated bending of the back and the joints is a healthful exercise. All these are scientiﬁcally established facts. 
The ablutions required prior to the contact prayers encourage us to use the toilet more frequently. This habit protects us from a common and devastating cancer, colon cancer. Harmful chemicals are excreted in the urine and fecal matter. If these excretions are kept in the colon for prolonged periods of time, the harmful materials are re-absorbed into the body, and cause cancer. 
Fasting during the month of Ramadan restores our expanded stomachs to their normal sizes, lowers our blood pressure through temporary dehydration, rids the body of harmful toxins, gives our kidneys a much needed rest, and reduces our weight by removing excessive and harmful fat.

Appendix  16 
Dietary Prohibitions 
The Quran teaches that God is extremely displeased with those who prohibit anything that was not speciﬁcally prohibited in the Quran ( 16:112 - 116). The upholding of any prohibitions not speciﬁcally mentioned in the Quran is tantamount to idolatry ( 6:142 -152). Such prohibitions represent some other god(s) besides God. If you worship God ALONE, you will uphold His teachings ALONE and honor the commandments and prohibitions instituted only by Him. 
The absolute speci ﬁcity of dietary prohibitions in the Quran is best illustrated in  6:145 -146. We learn from these two verses that when God prohibits "meat," He prohibits "meat" and nothing else, and when He prohibits "fat," that is what He speciﬁcally prohibits. These two verses inform us that "the meat" of pigs is prohibited, not "the fat." Obviously, God knew that in many countries, lard would be used in baked goods and other food products, and that such usage does not render the foods Haraam (prohibited). The Quran speciﬁcally prohibits four meats ( 2:173 ,  5:3 ,  6:142 - 145, and  16:112 ): 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1336 -----------------------------------------------------
Say, "I do not ﬁnd in what was revealed to me anything prohibited for any eater unless it is (1) carrion, (2) running blood, (3) the meat of pigs, for it is unclean, and (4) meat blasphemously dedicated to other than God." If one is forced to eat these without being malicious or deliberate, then your Lord is Forgiver, Most Merciful. [  6:145  ] 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1337 -----------------------------------------------------
Appendix  17 
Death 
Death is a great mystery to most people. Not so for the students of the Quran. We learn that death is exactly like sleeping; complete with dreams ( 6:60 ,  40:46 ). The period between death and resurrection passes like one night of sleep ( 2:259 ;  6:60 ;  10:45 ;  16:21 ;  18:11 , 19, 25;  30:55 ). 
At the moment of death, everyone knows his or her destiny; Heaven or Hell. For the disbelievers, death is a horrible event; the angels beat them on the faces and rear ends as they snatch away their souls ( 8:50 ,  47:27 ,  79:1 ). 
Consistently, the Quran talks about two deaths, the ﬁrst death took place when we failed to make a stand with God's absolute authority (Appendix  7 ). That ﬁrst death lasted until we were born into this world. The second death terminates our life in this world ( 2:28 ,  22:66 ,  40:11 ). 
Note: The following is a reproduction of the lead article from the February, 1990 issue of the Submitters Perspective, the monthly bulletin of United Submitters International. This was the second to last issue that was written by Dr. Khalifa. It was completed and mailed ahead of time, in December, 1989. Dr. Khalifa was martyred on January 31, 1990 and his soul was taken directly to Paradise. 
The Righteous Do Not Really Die They Go Straight to Heaven 
Give good news to those who believe and work righteousness that they will have gardens with ﬂowing streams. When provided with provisions of fruits therein, they will say, "This is what was given to us in the past." They will be given similar provisions, and they will have pure spouses therein. They abide therein forever. ( 2:25 ) 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1338 -----------------------------------------------------
Do not think that those who are killed in the cause of God are dead; they are alive at their Lord, being provided for. ( 3:169 ) 
Do NOT say about those who are killed in the cause of God, "They are dead." For they are alive, but you do not perceive. ( 2:154 ) 
O you who believe, you shall respond to God and the messenger when he invites to what keeps you alive. ( 8:24 ) 
Those who emigrate in the cause of God, then get killed or die, God will surely provide for them a good provision. ( 22:58 ) 
They do not taste death, beyond the ﬁrst death, and God spares them the retribution of Hell. ( 44:56 ) 
He was told, "Enter Paradise." He said, "I wish my people (on earth) know; that my Lord has forgiven me and honored me." ( 36:26 -27) 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1339 -----------------------------------------------------
As stated in  3:81  and  46:9 , God's Messenger of the Covenant does not bring anything new; everything I receive and pass on to you is already in the Quran. However, the Quran is full of information that is kept by Almighty God for revelation at a speci ﬁc time. Now is the time to look at the verses shown above and learn the great news: THE RIGHTEOUS DO NOT DIE; when their lives on this earth come to the predetermined end, the angel of death simply invites them to leave their earthly bodies and move on to Heaven, the same Paradise where Adam and Eve once lived. Heaven has been in existence since Adam and Eve. We learn from  89:27 -30 that God invites the believers' souls: "Enter My Paradise." 
MY OWN EXPERIENCE 
When God's covenant with the prophets was fulﬁlled in accordance with  3:81 , I was taken to Heaven where the righteous live NOW ( 4:69 ). While my body was down here on earth, I was in the same Paradise of Adam & Eve. 
THE DISBELIEVERS 
As for the disbelievers, they know at the moment of death that they are destined for Hell. The angels beat them up on the faces and rear ends ( 8:50   &  47:27 ), order them to evict their souls ( 6:93 ), then "snatch their souls" ( 79:1 ). The Quran teaches that the disbelievers go through 2 deaths ( 2:28  &  40:11 ). They will be put to death - a state of nothingness during which they see Hell day and night in a continuous nightmare that lasts until the Day of Judgment ( 40:46 ). Hell is not yet in existence ( 40:46 ,  89:23 ). 
Of Course, the Righteous Depart 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1340 -----------------------------------------------------
As far as people are concerned, the righteous "die." People do not realize that the righteous simply leave their bodies, and move on to Paradise. The verses shown above are self explanatory. They tell us that the righteous die only once - the one death we have already experienced as a consequence of the great fued ( 38:69 ). In  36:26 -27, we see the best evidence that the righteous go to Paradise, while their friends and relatives are still living on earth. Like going to Hawaii and waiting for us there. See also  16:32  &  6:60 - 62.

Appendix 18 
Quran: All You Need For Salvation 
The words of the Quran speak in 19:64 , saying, "We come down in accordance with the commandments of your Lord. To Him belongs the past, present, and the future. Your Lord never forgets." God did not forget, for example, to tell us how to sleep ( 18:109 , 31:27 ). Yet, the fabricators of such false doctrine as Hadith & Sunna have come up with religious teachings dictating to their followers how to sleep, and even how to cut your nails. The Sacred Mosque in Mecca and the illegal "Sacred Mosque" of Medina, hire some individuals to seek out the exhausted visitors and beat them with a stick if they fall asleep on the wrong side! 
The Quran proclaims that the Quran is complete, perfect, and fully detailed ( 6:19 , 38, 114, 115; 50:45 ), and that religious regulations not speciﬁcally instituted in the Quran constitute a religion other than Islam, i.e., Submisssion ( 42:21 , 17:46 ). The true believers uphold the Quran, the whole Quran, and nothing but the Quran. This principle is conﬁrmed by the Quran's mathematical code. Verse 46 of Sura 17 proclaims that we shall uphold the Quran ALONE. The word "ALONE" occurs in the Quran 6 times: 7:70 , 17:46 , 39:45 , 40: 12 & 84, and 60:4 . All these occurrences refer to God, except 17:46 . When we add the numbers of suras and verses which refer to "GOD ALONE," we get 361, 19x19. This proves that 17:46 refers to "the Quran ALONE." 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1342 -----------------------------------------------------
Appendix 19 
Hadith & Sunna: Satanic 
Innovations 
Which Hadith, other than God and His revelations, do they uphold? [ 45:6 ] 
The Quran is not a fabricated Hadith; ...it details everything. [ 12:111 ] 
Some people uphold vain Hadith to divert others from the path of God. [ 31:6 ] 
The only Sunna to follow shall be God's Sunna. [ 17:77 , 33:62 , 48:23 , 6:114 ] 
The Quran informs us that some enemies of the Prophet, described as "human and jinn devils," will fabricate lies and attribute them to the Prophet ( 6:112 , 25:31 ). This is precisely what happened after the prophet Muhammad's death; Hadith (oral) and Sunna (actions) were invented and attributed to the Prophet. Hadith and Sunna are satanic innovations because they: [1] defy the divine assertions that the Quran is complete, perfect, fully detailed, and shall be the only source of religious guidance ( 6:19 , 38, 114 & 45:6 -7), [2] blaspheme against the Prophet and depict him as a vicious tyrant who did not uphold the Quran, and [3] create false doctrines based on superstition, ignorance, and indefensible nonsensical traditions. The prophet Muhammad was enjoined, in very strong words, from issuing any religious teachings besides the Quran ( 69:38 -48). 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1343 -----------------------------------------------------
Some Muslims compromise: "If a Hadith agrees with the Quran we will accept it, and if it contradicts the Quran, we will reject it!" Such premise proves that these people do not believe God's assertions that the Quran is "complete, perfect and fully detailed." The moment they seek guidance from anything besides the Quran, no matter how "right" it seems, they fall into Satan's trap (see 63:1 ). For they have rejected God's word and set up another god besides God ( 18:57 ). See Appendix 33 . 
The Quran's mathematical miracle provides mathematical evidence that the Quran shall be our only source of religious teachings. Here are just 2 examples: 
1. = "We did not leave anything out of this book," is in Verse 38 (19x2) and consists of 19 Arabic letters ( 6:38 ). 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1344 -----------------------------------------------------
2. ="He sent down this book fully detailed," is in Verse 114 (19x6) and consists of 19 Arabic letters ( 6:114 ). 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1345 -----------------------------------------------------
Appendix  20 
Quran: Unlike Any Other Book 
The Quran is God's Final Testament to the world, and He has pledged to protect it from the slightest distortion ( 15:9 ). Thus, the Quran is surrounded by invisible forces that guard it and serve it ( 13:39 ,  41:42 ,  42:24 ). 
Unlike any other book, the Quran is taught by God ( 55:1 -2); He teaches us what we need at the time we need it. This is why we read the Quran hundreds of times without getting bored. We can read a novel, for example, only once. But the Quran can be read an in ﬁnite number of times, and we derive new and valuable information from it every time. On the other hand, the insincere readers - those who read the Quran to ﬁnd fault with it - are diverted from the Quran ( 7:146 ,  17:45 ,  18:57 ,  41:44 ). In fact, God's invisible forces help them ﬁnd the faults they seek. Since the Quran is perfect, such "faults" serve only to reveal the stupidity of God's enemies. 
God uses His own attributes to describe the Quran; He calls the Quran " `Azeem = Great" ( 15:87 ), "Hakeem = Full of wisdom" ( 36:2 ), "Majid = Glorious" ( 50:1 ), and "Karim = Honorable" ( 56:77 ). What can we say? 
Since the Quran is God's message to all the people, regardless of their language, the Quran is accessible to the believers, regardless of their language ( 41:44 ). This explains a profound phenomenon: the believers who do not know Arabic know the Quran better than the Arabic speaking unbelievers. Because of the invisible forces serving the Quran, it is readily and enjoyably accessible to the sincere believers, and utterly inaccessible to the unbelievers ( 17:45 ,  18:57 ,  56:79 ). 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1346 -----------------------------------------------------
Appendix  21 
Satan: Fallen Angel 
In God's kingdom, certain creatures are necessarily given the powers needed to perform their duties. Satan believed that his God-given powers qualiﬁed him to function as an independent god. As evidenced by the prevalence of misery, disease, accidents, and war in his dominion, we now know that Satan is incompetent. 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1347 -----------------------------------------------------
The Quran clearly states that Satan was an angel, by virtue of the immense powers and rank bestowed upon him. This is why he is addressed as an angel ( 2:34 ,  7:11 ,  15:29 ,  17:61 ,  18:50 ,  20:116 ,  38:71 ) prior to his fall. By de ﬁnition, a jinn is a fallen angel ( 18:50 ). Satan's rebellion teaches us that the angels were created with minds of their own, and absolute freedom of choice ( 2:34 ). 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1348 -----------------------------------------------------
Appendix 22 
Jesus 
The Quran, informs us that Jesus was a human messenger of God whose sole mission was to deliver God's message; he never possessed any power, and is now dead ( 4:171 , 5:75 , 117). Those who consider Jesus to be God, or Son of God, or part of a trinity are "pagans" ( 5:17 , 72, 73). Outstanding Christian scholars have reached these same conclusions (THE MYTH OF GOD INCARNATE, John Hick, ed., The Westminster Press, Philadelphia, 1977 & THE MYTH MAKER, Hyam Maccoby, Harper & Row 1986). Christianity is the product of Nicene (AD 325). 
The Bible's Jesus 
Jesus proclaimed aloud: ``Whoever puts faith in me believes not so much in 
me as in him who sent me; ..... For I have not spoken on my own; no, the 
Father who sent me has commanded me what to say and how to speak. Since I know that his commandment means eternal life, whatever I say is spoken just as he instructed me.'' [ John 12:44-50 ] 
"I cannot do anything of myself. I judge as I hear, and my judgment is honest because I am not seeking my own will but the will of him who sent me." [ John 5:30 ] 
Jesus said: ``My doctrine is not my own; it comes from him who sent me.'' [ John 7:16 ] 
"Men of Israel, listen to me! Jesus the Nazorean was a man whom God sent to you with miracles, wonders, and signs as his credentials. These God worked through him in your midst, as you well know." [ Acts 2:22 ] 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1349 -----------------------------------------------------
``...The man who hears my word and has faith in him who sent me possesses eternal life.'' [ John 5:24 ] 
"Whoever welcomes me welcomes, not me, but him who sent me." [ Mattew 10:40 , Mark 9:37 , Luke 9:48, & John 13:20 ] 
``...I have not come of myself. I was sent by One who has the right to send, and him you do not know. I know him because it is from him I come; he sent me.'' [ John 7:28-29 ] 
Jesus looked up to heaven and said, ``...Eternal life is this: to know you, the only true God, and him whom you have sent, Jesus Christ.'' [ John 17:1-3 ] 
All who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. [ Romans 8:14 ] 
Jesus looked upward and said, ``Father, I thank you for having heard me. I know that you always hear me but I have said this for the sake of the crowd, that they may believe that you sent me.'' [ John 11:41-42 ] 
As he was setting out on a journey a man came running up, knelt down before him and asked, ``Good Teacher, what must I do to share in everlasting life?'' Jesus answered, ``Why do you call me good? No one is good but God alone.'' [ Mark 10:17 -18 ] 
``None of those who call me `Lord' will enter the kingdom of God, but only the one who does the will of my Father in heaven." [ Matthew 7:21 ] 
``...Go to my brothers and tell them, `I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.' '' [ John 20:17 ] 
``God is my Lord and your Lord; you shall worship Him alone. This is the right path." [ Quran 3:51 , 19:36 , & 43:64 ] 
Trinity, the doctrine of God taught by Christians that asserts that God is one in essence but three in ``person,'' Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Neither the word Trinity, nor the explicit doctrine as such, appears in the New Testament, nor did Jesus and his followers intend to contradict the Shema in 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1350 -----------------------------------------------------
the Old Testament: ``Hear O Israel: The Lord our God is one'' (Deut. 6:4 ). [ Encyclopedia Britannica, 1975 ] 
Jesus' Death 
This has been the single most controversial subject in the world. The Quran's miraculous mathematical code has now provided the ﬁnal answer to this topic: 
Jesus' soul was raised, i.e., he was put to death prior to the arrest and cruciﬁxion of his body. Thus, his persecutors arrested, tortured, and cruciﬁed an empty body - Jesus was already gone to the world of souls ( 3:55 , 4:157 ). 
They plotted and schemed, but so did God, and God is the best schemer. Thus, God said, ``O Jesus, I am putting you to death, and raising you to Me; I will save you from the disbelievers.'' [ Quran 3:54 -55 ] 
They claimed that they killed the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, the messenger of God! In fact, they never killed him; they never cruciﬁed him; they were led to believe that they did. [ Quran 4:157 ] 
Mercifully, God has given our generation a living example of a person whose soul departed this world, but his body continued to live for 19 months. On November 25, 1984, doctors at the Humana Hospital of Louisville, Kentucky removed the diseased heart of Mr. William Schroeder and replaced it with a plastic and metal pump (THE NEW YORK TIMES, Monday, November 26, 1984). 
On the 19th day after this historic operation - Thursday, December 13, 1984 - Mr. Schroeder, the soul, the real person, departed this world. Mr. Schroeder died. But his body continued to function with the artiﬁcial heart implanted in his body. The world was told that he "probably suffered a stroke" (THE NEW YORK TIMES, December 14, 1984). Signi ﬁcantly, only one day before Mr. Schroeder's departure, he talked with President Ronald Reagan on national TV, and demanded that the Social Security 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1351 -----------------------------------------------------
Administration send his overdue check. He was perfectly alert. From the moment "he suffered a stroke," he did not recognize the day or time, nor his family members. In fact, Mr. Schroeder was no longer in this world. 
The Gospels state clearly that the arrested body of Jesus was oblivious to the events surrounding it: 
The chief priests, meanwhile, brought many accusations against Jesus. Pilate interrogated him again: "Surely you have some answer? See how many accusations they are leveling against you." But greatly to Pilate's surprise, Jesus made no further response. [ Mark 15:3 -5 ] 
Herod was extremely pleased to see Jesus. From the reports about him he had wanted for a long time to see him, and he was hoping to see him work some miracles. He questioned Jesus at considerable length, but Jesus made no response. The chief priests and scribes were at hand to accuse him vehemently. Herod and his guards then treated him with contempt and insult. [ Luke 23:8-11 ] 
The Savior said to me, "He whom you saw on the tree, glad and laughing, this is the living Jesus. But this one into whose hands and feet they drive the nails is the ﬂeshly part. [Apocalypse of Peter, VII, 3, 81] from THE NAG HAMMADI LIBRARY (Harper & Row, 1977, James M. Robinson, ed, Page 339). 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1352 -----------------------------------------------------
The facts that (1) Mr. Schroeder's soul departed on the 19th day after the operation, and (2) his body survived for 19 months, are uncanny reminders that God wanted the world to know the parallel between Schroeder's situation, and the proven account of Jesus' departure prior to the arrest, torture, and cruciﬁxion of his soulless body.

Appendix 24 
Tampering with the Word of God 
A superhuman mathematical system pervades the Quran and serves to guard and authenticate every element in it. Nineteen years after the Prophet's death, some scribes injected two false verses at the end of Sura 9 , the last sura revealed in Medina. The evidence presented in this Appendix incontrovertibly removes these human injections, restores the Quran to its pristine purity, and illustrates a major function of the Quran's mathematical code, namely, to protect the Quran from the slightest tampering. Thus, the code rejects ONLY the false injections 9:128-129. 
"Surely, we have revealed this scripture, and surely, we will preserve it." [ 15:9 ] 
The Quran is God's Final Testament. Hence the divine pledge to keep it perfectly preserved. To assure us of both the divine authorship, and the perfect preservation of the Quran, the Almighty author has rendered the Quran mathematically composed. As proven by the physical evidence in Appendix 1 , such mathematical composition is far beyond human capabilities. The slightest violation of God's Final Testament is destined to stand out in glaring disharmony. A deviation by only 1 - one sura, one verse, one word, even one letter - is immediately exposed. 
Nineteen years after the Prophet Muhammad's death, during the reign of Khalifa `Uthman, a committee of scribes was appointed to make several copies of the Quran to be dispatched to the new Muslim lands. The copies were to be made from the original Quran which was written by Muhammad's hand (Appendix 28 ). 
This committee was supervised by `Uthman Ibn `Affaan, `Ali Ibn Abi Taaleb, Zeid Ibn Thaabet, Ubayy Ibn Ka`ab, `Abdullah Ibn Al-Zubair, Sa`eed Ibn Al-`Aas, and `Abdul Rahman Ibn Al-Haareth Ibn Heshaam. The Prophet, of course, had written the Quran in its chronological order of revelation (Appendix 23 ), together with the necessary instructions to place every piece in its proper position. The last sura revealed in Medina was Sura 9 . Only Sura 110 , a very short sura, was revealed after Sura 9 , in Mina. 
The committee of scribes finally came to Sura 9 , and put it in its proper place. One of the scribes suggested adding a couple of verses to honor the Prophet. The majority of scribes agreed. `Ali was outraged. He vehemently maintained that the word of God, written down by the hand of His final prophet, must never be altered. 
Ali's protest is documented in many references, but I cite and reproduce here the classic reference AL ITQAAN FEE 'ULUM AL QURAN by Jalaluddin Al-Suyuty, Al-Azhareyyah Press, Cairo, Egypt, 1318 AH, Page 59 [see Insert 1]. 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1356 -----------------------------------------------------
Translation: `Ali was asked: "Why are you staying home?" He said, "Something has been added to the Quran, and I have pledged never to put on my street clothes, except for the prayer, until the Quran is restored." 
[ Insert 1 ] 
The horrendous dimensions of this crime can be realized once we look at the consequences: 
(1) `Uthman was assassinated, and `Ali was installed as the fourth Khalifa. 
(2) A 50-year war erupted between the new Khalifa and his supporters on one side, and the Mohammedan distorters of the Quran on the other side. 
(3) `Ali was martyred, and eventually his family, the prophet Muhammad's family, except for some women and children, were killed. 
(4) The disaster culminated in the infamous Battle of Karbala, where `Ali's son, Hussein, and his family were massacred. 
(5) The Muslims were deprived of the pure, unaltered, Quran for 1400 years. 
The distorters of the Quran finally won the war, and the "official" history that came to us represented the victors' point of view. This apparent victory for God's enemies was, of course, in accordance with God's will. In just two decades after the Prophet's death, the idol worshipers who were defeated by the Prophet in the conquest of Mecca (632 AD) reverted to idolatry. Ironically, this time around their idol was the Prophet himself. Such idol worshipers obviously did not deserve to possess the pure Quran. Hence the blessed martyrdom of the true believers who tried to restore the Quran, and the apparent victory for the distorters of God's word. 
The first peace time ruler after this lengthy and disastrous war was Marwan Ibn Al Hakam (died 65 AH/684 AD). One of the first duties he performed was to destroy the original Quran, the one that was so scrupulously written by the Prophet's own hand, "fearing it might become the cause of NEW disputes" [see `ULUM AL-QURAN, by Ahmad von Denffer, Islamic Foundation, Leicester, United Kingdom, 1983, Page 56.]. The question an intelligent person must ask is: "If the original Quran were identical to the Quran in circulation at that time, why did Marwan Ibn Al-Hakam have to destroy it?!" 
Upon examining the oldest Islamic references, we realize that the false injections, 9:128-129, were always suspect. For example, we read in Bukhary's famous Hadith, and Al-Suyuty's famous Itqaan, that every single verse in the Quran was verified by a multiplicity of witnesses "except Verses 128 and 129 of Sura 9 ; they were found only with Khuzeimah Ibn Thaabet Al-Ansaary." When some 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1357 -----------------------------------------------------
people questioned this improper exception, someone came up with a Hadith stating that "the testimony of Khuzeimah equals the testimony of two men!!!" 
Strangely, the false injections 9:128-129 are labeled in the traditional Quran printings as "Meccan" [see Insert 2]. 
The Title Figure of Sura 9 from a standard Quran, showing that this sura is Medinan, "except for the last two verses; they are Meccan"!!! 
[Insert 2] 
How could these `Meccan' verses be found with Khuzeimah, a late `Medinan' Muslim?! How could a Medinan sura contain Meccan verses, when the universal convention has been to label as `Medinan' all revelations after the Prophet's Hijerah from Mecca??!! Despite these discrepancies, plus many more glaring contradictions associated with Verses 9:128-129, no one dared to question their authenticity. The discovery of the Quran's mathematical code in 1974, however, ushered in a new era where the authenticity of every element in the Quran is proven (Appendix 1). 
As it turns out, the injection of the two false Verses 9:128-129 resulted in: (1) demonstrating the major function of the Quran's mathematical system, and (2) producing an awesome miracle in its own right, and (3) distinguishing the true believers from the hypocrites (they uphold traditions). 
The translation of the two false verses is shown in Insert 3: 
"A messenger has come to you from among you who wants no hardship to af ﬂict you, and cares about you, and is compassionate towards the believers, merciful. If they turn away, then say, 
'Suf ﬁcient for me is God, there is no god except He. I put my trust in Him. He is the Lord with the great throne.' " 
[Insert 3] 
THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE 
[1] The first violation of the Quran's code by Verses 9:128-129 appeared when the count of the word "God" (Allah) in the Quran was found to be 2699, which is not a multiple of 19, unless we remove one. The count of the word "God" is shown at the bottom of each page in this translation. The total 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1358 -----------------------------------------------------
shown at the end of the Quran is 2698, 19x142, because the false injections 9:128-129 have been removed. 
[2] The sum of all the verse numbers where the word "God" occurs is 118123, or 19x6217. This total is obtained by adding the numbers of verses wherever the word "God" is found. If the false Verse 9:129 is included, this phenomenon disappears. 
[3] As shown at the end of Sura 9 in this translation, the total occurrence of the word "God" to the end of Sura 9 is 1273, 19x67. If the false injections 9:128-129 were included, the total would have become 1274, not a multiple of 19. 
[4] The occurrence of the word "God" from the first Quranic initial ("A.L.M." of 2:1 ) to the last initial ("N." of 68:1 ) totals 2641, or 19x139. Since it is easier to list the suras outside the initialed section of the Quran, Table 1 shows the 57 occurrences of the word "God" in that section. Subtracting 57 from the total occurrence of the word "God" gives us 2698- 57 = 2641 = 19x139, from the first initial to the last initial. If the human injections 9:128 and 129 were included, the count of the word "God" in the initialed section would have become 2642, not a multiple of 19.

[5] Sura 9 is an un-initialed sura, and if we look at the 85 un-initialed suras, we find that the word "God" occurs in 57 of these suras, 19x3. The total number of verses in the suras where the word "God" is found is 1045, 19x55. If 9:128-129 were included, the verses containing the word "God" would increase by 1. 
[6] The word "God" from the missing Basmalah (Sura 9 ) to the extra Basmalah (Sura 27 ) occurs in 513 verses, 19x27, within 19 suras (Table 2). If the false Verses 9:128-129 were included, the number of verses containing the word "God" would have become 514, and this phenomenon would have disappeared.

[7] The word "Elaah" which means "god" occurs in Verses 9:129. The total occurrence of this word in the Quran is 95, 19x5. The inclusion of 9:128-129 causes this word to increase by 1, to 96. 
[8] The INDEX TO THE WORDS OF THE QURAN, lists 116 "Rasool" (Messenger) words. One of these words is in 9:128. By removing this false verse, 115 "Rasool" words remain. Another "Rasool" word which must be excluded from counting is in 12:50 , since it refers to the "messenger of Pharaoh," not the messenger of God. Thus, the total occurrence of "Rasool" of God is 114, 19x6. 
[9] Another important word that occurs in the false Verses 9:128-129 is the word "Raheem" (Merciful). This word is used in the Quran exclusively as a name of God, and its total count is 114, 19x6, after removing the word "Raheem" of 9:128, which refers to the prophet. According to 7:188 , 10:49 , and 72:21 the Prophet did not possess any power of mercy. 
[10] The INDEX lists 22 occurrences of the word " `Arsh" (Throne). After removing the false injection 9:129, and the " `Arsh" of Joseph which occurs in 12:100 , and the " `Arsh" of the Queen of Sheba ( 27:23 ), we end up with 19 " `Arsh" words. This proves that the word " `Arsh" of 9:129 does not belong in the Quran. 
[11] The Quranic command "Qul" (Say) occurs in the Quran 332 times. Also, the word "Qaaloo" (They said) occurs the same number of times, 332. Since the false Verse 9:129 contains the word "Qul" (Say), its inclusion would have destroyed this typical Quranic phenomenon. 
[12] The Quran contains 6234 numbered verses and 112 un-numbered verses (Basmalahs). Thus, the total number of verses in the Quran is 6346, 19x334. The false Verses 9:128-129 violate this important criterion of the Quran's code. 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1362 -----------------------------------------------------
[13] In addition to violating the numbers of words as listed above, 9:128-129 violate the Quran's mathematical structure. When we add the number of verses in each sura, plus the sum of verse numbers (1+2+3+... +n, where n=number of verses), plus the number of each sura, the cumulative total for the whole Quran comes to 346199, or 19x19x959. This phenomenon confirms the authenticity of every verse in the Quran, while excluding 9:128-129. Table 3 is an abbreviated illustration of the calculations of Item 13. This phenomenon is impossible if the false Verses 9:128- 129 are included.

[14] When we carry out the same calculations as in Item 13 above, but for the 85 un-initialed suras only, which include Sura 9 , the cumulative total is also a multiple of 19. The cumulative total for all un-initialed suras is 156066, or 19x8214. This result depends on the fact that Sura 9 consists of 127 verses, not 129. The data are shown in Table 4. The false verses would have destroyed this criterion.

[16] By adding the sura number of the un-initialed suras, plus the number of verses, plus the sum of verse numbers from the missing Basmalah ( 9:1 ) to the end of the Quran, the grand total comes to 116090, or 19x6110. These data are in Table 6. If Verses 9:128-129 are included, the number of verses for Sura 9 becomes 129, and the grand total becomes 116349, not a multiple of 19. 
[17] When the same calculations of Item 16 are done for all the verses from the missing Basmalah of Sura 9 to the extra Basmalah of Sura 27 , the grand total comes to 119966, or 19x6314. This phenomenon would be destroyed, and the total would no longer be divisible by 19, if the number of 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1365 -----------------------------------------------------
verses in Sura 9 were 129. Since this phenomenon is also related to the absence of Basmalah from Sura 9 , it is explained and the detailed data are given in table form in Appendix 29 .

Let us look at all the verses whose digits add up to 10, from the missing Basmalah of Sura 9 , to the extra Basmalah of Sura 27 . If Sura 9 consisted of 129 verses, the grand total would be 2472, instead of 2470 (19x130); 2472 is not a multiple of 19, and this phenomenon would have disappeared. The data are in Table 8.

[20] The falsifiers wanted us to believe that Sura 9 consists of 129 verses. The number 129 ends with the digit "9." Let us look at the first sura and the last sura whose number of verses ends with the digit "9." These are Sura 10 and Sura 104 . By adding the sura number, plus the number of verses, plus the sum of verse numbers, from Sura 10 to Sura 104 , we get a grand total that equals 23655, or 19x1245. The details are shown in Table 9. 
The inclusion of Sura 9 with the wrong number of verses, 129, would have altered both the sum of verse numbers and the cumulative total - the sum of verse numbers would have become 627+129=756, and the cumulative total would not be 23655 - and the Quran's code would have been violated (Table 9).

[21] The false injection consisted of Verses 128 and 129 at the end of Sura 9. If we look at the numbers 128 and 129, we see two 1's, two 2's, one 8, and one 9. Now let us look at all the verses in 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1370 -----------------------------------------------------
the Quran, and count all the 1's we see. This means the 1's we see in verses 1, 10, 11, 12, 13... 21, 31, and so on. The total count of the 1's is 2546 (19x134), provided the correct number of verses in Sura 9 , 127, is used. If 128 and 129 are included, the grand total becomes 2548, which is not a multiple of 19 (Table 11).

[22] Since Sura 9 is an un-initialed sura, let us look at all the verse numbers in the 85 un-initialed suras and count all the 1's we see. As shown in Table 10, the total count of the digit "1" in the un- initialed suras is 1406, or 19x74. Obviously, if Sura 9 consisted of 129 verses, we would see two additional 1's, from 128 and 129, and the code would be violated. 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1372 -----------------------------------------------------
[23] Following the same process explained in Items 22 and 23 for the digit "1," let us count all the 2's, 8's and 9's in all the verse numbers of the whole Quran. As shown in Table 11, the total count of all the 2's, 8's, and 9's is 3382, or 19x178. This makes the grand total of all the 1's, 2's, 8's, and 9's 2546+3382 = 5928, 19x312. 
In this remarkable phenomenon, we considered every single verse in the Quran, and examined the individual digits that make up Verses 128 and 129. Since 128 and 129 contain 6 digits, the inclusion of these human injections causes the total count of these digits in the whole Quran to be 5928+6 = 5934, not a multiple of 19. 
[24] The total count of all the digits (1 through 9) in all the verse numbers of the 85 un-initialed suras, including Sura 9 with 127 verses, is 27075, or 19x19x75. 
[25] Adding up the digits of the Quran's suras and verses produces a multiple of 19, provided the correct number of verses for Sura 9 , 127, is taken. To do this, you make a list of the Quran's 114 suras and the number of verses in each sura. Add the digits of every sura number. The sum of digits of 10=1, 11=2, 12=3, 99=18, and so on. The total for all the suras is 975. The same thing is done for the numbers of verses in every sura. For example, Sura 2 consists of 286 verses. The digits of 286 add up to 2+8+6=16. For Sura 9 , the digits of its number of verses add up to 1+2+7=10. The total for all 114 suras is 906. Thus, the grand total for the sum of digits of all the suras and verses is 975+906 = 1881 = 19x99. Naturally, this observation would not be possible if Sura 9 consisted of 129 verses. Table 12 is abbreviated to illustrate the calculations.

[26] Miraculously, if we calculate the sum of digits for every sura in the Quran, and multiply the sum for each sura by the sum of digits of its number of verses, instead of adding, we still end up with a grand total that is a multiple of 19. For example, Sura 2 has 286 verses. The sum of digits of 2+8+6=16. So you multiply 2 by 16, and you get 32, instead of adding 2+16 as we did in Item 26. This is done for every sura in the Quran. The grand total for all the suras is 7771, or 19x409. Once again, every single verse in the Quran is confirmed, while the false verses are utterly rejected. See Table 13.

[27] Another truly awesome phenomenon: Sura 9 is an odd-numbered sura, and if we carry out the calculations described above for the odd-numbered suras only, we find that the total for the suras is 513 (19x27), the total for the verses is 437 (19x23), and the grand total for both is 513+437 = 950 (19x50). Table 14 illustrates this remarkable phenomenon.

[28] Let us take all the suras that consist of 127 verses or less. There are 105 such suras. The sum of the sura numbers of these 105 suras, plus the sum of their verse numbers is 10963, or 19x577. Sura 9 is the only sura that has 127 verses. See Table 15. If Sura 9 did consist of 129 verses, it would not be included in this list of suras, the total would be 10827 (10963-136), this phenomenon would have disappeared, and the Quran's code would have been violated.

[29] Since Sura 9 is odd-numbered, and its number of verses is also odd, let us look at all the odd- numbered suras whose number of verses is also odd. This gives us 27 suras: 1, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 25, 27, 29, 33, 35, 39, 43, 45, 57, 63, 81, 87, 91, 93, 97, 101, 103, 105, 107, 111, and 113. They consist of 7, 127, 123, 43, 99, 111, 77, 93, 69, 73, 45, 75, 89, 37, 29, 11, 29, 19, 15, 11, 5, 11, 3, 5, 7, 5, and 5 verses, respectively. The sum of these sura numbers, plus their sum of verse numbers is 2774, 19x146. If we take the wrong number of verses for Sura 9 , i.e., 129, this miracle disappears. 
[30] The correct number of verses in Sura 9 is 127, and this is a prime number - it is not divisible by any number except 1, and itself. Let us look at all the suras whose number of verses is a prime number. These are Suras 1 , 9 , 13 , 33, 43, 45, 57, 63, 81, 87, 93, 97, 101, 103, 105, 107, 111, and 113. The numbers of verses in these suras are 7, 127, 43, 73, 89, 37, 29, 11, 29, 19, 11, 5, 11, 3, 5, 7, 5, and 5, respectively. If you add the digits of these suras, you get 137, while the digits of the verses add up to 129. This makes the grand total of all the digits 137+129 = 266 = 19x14. 
[31] The distorters added two false verses to Sura 9 , and this caused the sura to have 129 verses. Since 129 consists of 3 digits, and is divisible by 3, let us look at the suras whose number of verses is divisible by 3, and consists of 3 digits. The total of these sura numbers is 71, and the total number of verses is 765. This produces a grand total of 71 + 765 = 836, or 19x44. The data are shown in Table 16.

If Sura 9 had 129 verses, it would have been included in this table, and would have destroyed this phenomenon. 
[32] If Sura 9 consisted of 129 verses, as the falsifiers would like us to believe, then let us look at all the suras which consist of 129 verses or more. There are 8 such suras. Their data are shown Table 17. If Sura 9 consisted of 129 verses, the total number of verses would have been 1577 + 129 = 1706, not a multiple of 19.

[33] The numbers 127, 128 and 129 have two digits in common, "1" and "2." Let us consider all the suras whose number of verses contains the digits 1 and 2. By adding the sura numbers plus the numbers of verses, we get 1159, 19x61. See Table 18. 
If Sura 9 consisted of 129 verses, the total would have become 1159+2 = 1161, not a multiple of 19.

[34] Sura 9 is a single-digit sura whose number of verses contains the digits 1 and 2. There is only one other sura that possesses these traits: Sura 5 is a single-digit sura, and it consists of 120 verses. As shown in Table 19, the number of verses in these two suras is 120+127 = 247 = 19x13. If Sura 9 consisted of 129 verses, the total would have been 247+2 = 249, not a multiple of 19.

[35] We looked at all the suras whose number of verses contains "1" and "2." Let us now look at all the suras whose number of verses begins with the digit "1." There are 30 suras that possess this quality: Suras 4 , 5 , 6 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 20 , 21 , 23 , 37 , 49 , 60 , 61 , 62 , 63 , 64, 65, 66, 82, 86, 87, 91, 93, 96, 100, and 101. 
Their numbers of verses are 176, 120, 165, 127, 109, 123, 111, 128, 111, 110, 135, 112, 118, 182, 18, 13, 14, 11, 11, 18, 12, 12, 19, 17, 19, 15, 11, 19, 11, and 11. The sum of verse numbers (1+2+3+...+n) for these 30 suras is 126122, or 19x6638. 
If Sura 9 consisted of 129 verses, the sum of their verse numbers would have been 126122 + 128 + 129 = 126379, and this total is not a multiple of 19. 
[36] Sura 9 consists of 127 verses, and 9+1+2+7 equals 19. Let us look at all the suras whose digits of sura and verses add up to 19. There are 10 suras that meet this specification, and the total of their sura numbers and numbers of verses is 1216, or 19x64. The data are shown in Table 20.

Mr. Gatut Adisoma of Masjid Tucson made the following two discoveries. 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1382 -----------------------------------------------------
[37] Sura 9 consists of 127 verses, and (9) plus (1+2+7) add up to 19. There are three other suras in the whole Quran whose sura digits add up to 9 and the digits of their number of verses add up to 10. These are suras 9 , 45 , 54 , and 72. They consist of 127, 37, 55, and 28 verses, respectively. The total number of verses in these three suras is 247, 19x13. 
If Sura 9 consisted of 129 verses, it would not be included in this table to begin with. See Table 21.

[38] If Sura 9 consisted of 129 verses as the distorters claimed, then there is only one other sura in the whole Quran whose sura digits add up to 9, and its number of verses' digits add up to 12, namely Sura 27 . 
As shown in Table 22, this combination, with 129 verses for Sura 9 , does not conform with the Quran's code. 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1383 -----------------------------------------------------

[39] Let us assume for awhile that Sura 9 consists of 129 verses. Since the number 129 ends with the digit "9," let us look at all the suras where the number of verses ends with the digit "9." 
We find 13 suras in the Quran whose number of verses ends with the digit "9." They are Suras 10 , 15 , 29 , 43 , 44 , 48 , 52 , 57 , 81 , 82 , 87 , 96 , and 104 . Their numbers of verses are 109, 99, 69, 89, 59, 29, 49, 29, 29, 19, 19, 19, and 9, respectively. 
As illustrated by Table 23, many conform with the Quran's code only if Sura 9 is excluded; it does not consist of 129 verses. Without Sura 9 , the total number of verses in these 13 suras is 627, 19x33. Additionally, the sura number, plus the number of verses, plus the sum the sum of verse numbers, add up to 23655, or 19x1245. These phenomena would have disappeared if Sura 9 consisted of 129 verses.

[40] Sura 9 is an odd-numbered sura whose number of verses ends with the digit "9." Let us now look at all the odd-numbered suras whose number of verses ends with "9." As shown in Table 24, the total of sura number and number of verses in these suras is 646, or 19x34. If Sura 9 had 129 verses, it would have been included in this group, and the total would have been 646+129+9 = 784, which is not a multiple of 19.

[41] By now, it is incontrovertibly proven that Sura 9 consists of 127 verses. Let us now look at the suras whose number of verses ends with "7." There are 7 such suras; they are Suras 1 , 9 , 25 , 26 , 45 , 86 , and 107 . Their numbers of verses are 7, 127, 77, 227, 37, 17, and 7 verses, respectively. The grand total of sura numbers plus number of verses for these seven suras is 798, 19x42. The details are shown in Table 25. Thus, every sura whose number of verses ends with the digit "7," including Sura 9 , conforms with the code.

[42] The last two verses of Sura 9 are 126 and 127. Since the falsifiers added two verses, let us look at the last two verses of every sura in the Quran, and count the digit "7," all of them, among these last two verses. 
As shown in Table 26, the total number of the digit "7" among the last two verses of every sura in the Quran is 38, 19x2.

If the last verse in Sura 9 was 129 instead of 127, the number of occurrences of the digit "7" would have been 37, not 38, and this criterion would have been destroyed. 
[43] Assuming that Sura 9 consists of 129 verses, let us look at all the suras that contain a verse No. 129. This means that we look at all the suras that consist of 129 or more verses. For example, Sura 2 consists of 286 verses. Therefore, it contains a verse that is assigned the number "129." We then take this verse and add it to all the other verses assigned the number 129 throughout the Quran. Under this assumption, there are 9 suras that contain a verse No. 129. Interestingly, we find that the total of sura numbers of these 9 suras is a multiple of 19 (114), while the total for the nine 129's can be a multiple of 19 if 2 is deducted from their total. In other words, we are told that one of these 9 suras contains 2 extra verses. The details are in Table 27. 
When we add 114, plus 1161, and remove 2, we get 1273, or 19x67. Compare this total (1273) with the total reported in the Item 44 below. Of the 9 suras listed in Table 27, which one has the extra 2 verses? The answer is provided in Item 44.

[44] To pinpoint the location of these two false verses, let us look at all the suras that contain a verse No. 128, while continuing to assume that Sura 9 consists of 129 verses. This will give us the same list of suras as in Table 27, and also bring in Sura 16 which has precisely 128 verses. 
As shown in Table 28, Sura 9 stands out in glaring disharmony; it is singled out as the sura that contains the false verses. The total of suras and verses becomes divisible by 19 only if Sura 9 is removed. Note that the divisible total, after removing Sura 9 , is 1273, 19x67, which is the same total obtained in Item 43 above after removing 2 verses. This remarkable phenomenon proves that Sura 9 could not contain a verse No. 128.

[45] Sura 9 is an un-initialed sura whose last two verses are 126 and 127. Let us take the 85 un- initialed suras, and add up the numbers of the last two verses in each sura. For example, the last two verses in Sura 1 are 6 and 7. Add 6+7 and you get 13. The next un-initialed sura is Sura 4 ; its last two verses are 175 and 176. Add 175+176 and you get 351. Do this for all un-initialed suras. The data are in Table 29. Thus, the last two verses of Sura 9 are confirmed to be 126 and 127.

[46] Let us now take the last two verses in every sura in the Quran, initialed and un-initialed, and add the digits of the last two verses in each sura (Table 30). It is readily obvious that the last two verses of every sura in the Quran are divinely fixed, and divinely guarded through this intricate mathematical code. The last two verses of Sura 9 are confirmed to be 126 & 127, not 128 & 129.

1824 = 19x96 
[47] Sura 9 consists of 127 verses, and 127 consists of 3 digits. Let us look at all the suras whose number of verses consists of 3 digits; these are suras 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23, 26, and 37. Their verse numbers are 286, 200, 176, 120, 165, 206, 127, 109, 123, 111, 128, 111, 110, 135, 112, 118, 227, and 182, respectively. By taking the last digit in each number of verses, and adding up these digits, we get 6+0+6+0+5+ 6+7+9+3+1+8+1+0+5+2+8+7+2 = 76 = 19x4. 
If Sura 9 consisted of 129 verses, the last digit in its number of verses would be 9 instead of 7, and the total of last digits would be 78 instead of 76, and this phenomenon would disappear. 
[48] Let us look at the list of suras shown in Item 47 above. Since the number of verses in Sura 9 is an odd number, let us now consider the odd-numbered verse numbers. There are 8 suras with a 3- digit, odd number of verses: Suras 6 , 9 , 10, 11, 12, 17, 20, and 26. Their numbers of verses are 165, 127, 109, 123, 111, 111, 135, & 227. 
The last digits in these numbers of verses are 5, 7, 9, 3, 1, 1, 5, and 7, respectively, and the sum of these digits is 38, or 19x2. Obviously, if Sura 9 consisted of 129 verses, its last digit would be 9, not 7, and the sum of the last digits would be 40, not a multiple of 19. The detailed data are shown in Table 31. Thus, we are getting more and more specific, as we zoom in on the last digit in the number of verses.

[49] Let us continue to work with the same group of suras of Items 47 and 48. Since Sura 9 is an odd- numbered sura, let us now remove all the even-numbered suras from the list of suras shown in Item 47. Now we have odd-numbered suras, with odd- numbered verses. There are only three such suras in the whole Quran: 9, 11, and 17. Their numbers of verses are 127, 123, and 111 (Table 32). If Sura 9 consisted of 129 verses, this remarkable phenomenon would have been destroyed.

(19x19) 
[50] Let us continue to work with the three suras listed in Item 49. These are all the suras in the Quran whose number is odd (like Sura 9 ), their number of verses consists of 3 digits (like Sura 9 ), and their number of verses is also odd (like Sura 9 ). 
As shown in Table 32, the verse numbers of these 3 suras are 127, 123, and 111. Just add the individual digits, and you get 1 + 2 + 7 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1=19. 
Obviously, this phenomenon depends on the now proven truth that Sura 9 consists of 127 verses. If Sura 9 consisted of 129 verses, the only suras in the Quran that possess the above stated qualities would have added up to 1+2+9+1+2+3+1+1+1 = 21. In other words, this important component of the Quran's mathematical code would have disappeared. 
[51] There are three suras (1) whose numbers are odd, (2) their numbers of verses are odd, and (3) the number of verses consists of 3 digits. They are Suras: 9, 11, and 17 (see Items 48 through 50 for the flow of this point). Just add the individual digits that make up the three sura numbers, and you get 9+1+1+1+7=19. 
[52] The number 129 is divisible by 3. If Sura 9 consisted of 129 verses as the distorters claimed, then it would be (1) an odd-numbered sura that (2) consists of a 3-digit number of verses, (3) the number of verses is odd, and (4) the number of verses is divisible by 3. There are only two suras in the whole Quran that possess these qualities: Sura 11 with 123 verses, and Sura 17 with 111 verses. The sum of digits of both sura numbers and the numbers of verses comes to 1+1+1+2+3+1+7+1+1+1 = 19. This can be observed only if Sura 9 consists of 127 verses. 
[53] Sura 9 is (1) odd-numbered, (2) its number of verses is odd, (3) its number of verses ends with the digit "7," (4) its number of verses is a prime number, and (5) the sura number is divisible by 3 & 9. The only two suras that possess these qualities are: Sura 9 (127 verses), and Sura 45 (37 verses). Just add the digits you see: 
9+1+2+7=19 & 4+5+3+7=19; Total for both suras = 19+19 = 38. 
[54] Let us assume that Sura 9 does have 129 verses. In that case we will have only two suras in the whole Quran whose number begins with 9, and their number of verses ends with 9: Sura 9 (129 verses) and Sura 96 (19 verses). As detailed in Table 33, the grand total of sura number, plus the number of verses, plus the sum of verse numbers is 8828, not a multiple of 19. 
Table 33: Suras whose numbers begins with "9" and their 
number of verses ends with "9."

By adding the sura numbers, plus the number of verses in each sura, plus the sum of verse numbers, the grand total comes to 34744, not a multiple of 19 Table 35).

[56] For the last time, let us assume that Sura 9 consists of 129 verses. We have here a sura that (1) is an odd numbered sura, (2) its number is divisible by 3, (3) the number of verses, 129, is also divisible by 3, and (4) the number of verses ends with the digit "9." There is only one sura that possesses these qualities: Sura 15 is divisible by 3, its number of verses is 99, which is divisible by 3 and ends with the digit "9." If Sura 9 consisted of 129, and we added the sura and verse numbers for these two suras, we would end up with the following results: 9 + 129 + 15 + 99 = 252 - not a multiple of 19. 
If we throw away the false number 129, we have one sura in the Quran whose number is odd, and its number of verses is divisible by 3 and ends with the digit 9 - Sura 15 . Now we have the following result: 
15 + 99 = 114 = 19x6. 
[57] For some time now, we have been dealing with numbers. Let us now look at specific words and letters that occur in the false injections 9:128-129. 
The last statement in 9:127 describes the disbelievers as "LAA YAFQAHOON" (they do not comprehend). Thus, the last letter in Sura 9 is "N" (Noon). 
According to the falsifiers, the last verse is 129, and the last letter is "M" (Meem), since the last false word is "AZEEM." 
Now let us look at the first letter and the last letter of every sura from the beginning of the Quran to Sura 9 , and calculate their gematrical (numerical) values. Table 37 shows that the last true letter in 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1400 -----------------------------------------------------
Sura 9 must be "N," not "M."

[58] Sister Ihsan Ramadan of Masjid Tucson counted all the suras in the Quran which end with the letter "N" (Noon), the last letter in Sura 9 . 
She found that 43 suras end with the same letter as Sura 9 (N) - suras 1 , 2 , 3, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 21, 23, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 43, 44, 46, 49, 51, 58, 61, 62, 63, 66, 67, 68, 70, 77, 81, 83, 84, 95, 107, and 109. Just add the sura numbers + number of suras that end with "N", and you get: 
1919. 
Thus, the last letter in Sura 9 is once again confirmed to be "N," not "M." 
[59] Now let us look at the crucial expression " LA ELAAHA ELLA HOO " (There is no god except He). This phrase occurs in the false injection 9:129. 
This very special expression occurs 29 times in 19 suras (Table 38). By adding the sura numbers of the 19 suras, plus the verse numbers where the phrase " LAA ELAAHA ELLA HOO " occurs, plus the number of occurrences of this crucial phrase, the grand total comes to 2128, or 19x112. This awesome result is dependent on the fact that 9:128-129 do not belong in the Quran. 
Obviously, if 9:129 were included, the crucial expression " LA ELAAHA ELLA HOO ," the First Pillar of Islam, would not conform with the mathematical code.

[60] The first occurrence of " LA ELAAHA ELLA HOO " is in 2:163 , and the last occurrence is in 73:9 . If we add the sura number, plus the number of verses, plus the sum of verse numbers from the first occurrence to the last occurrence, the grand total comes to 316502, or 19x16658. 
Table 39 presents the detailed data. Naturally, if " LAA ELAAHA ELLA HOO " of the false verse 129 were included, this phenomenon would have disappeared.

If 9:129 were part of the Quran, the total in Table 40 would have been: 323 + 129 = 452, not a multiple of 19. God rejects what the hypocrites utter, even if it is the truth ( 63:1 ). 
The Ultimate Quranic Miracle 
[62] Brother Abdullah Arik has discovered what I consider to be the ultimate Quranic miracle. This miraculous phenomenon incontrovertibly authenticates every single verse in the Quran - the number of verses in every sura, and the numbers assigned to every single verse in the Quran - while exposing and rejecting the false injections, 9:128-129. To witness this great phenomenon, see Page Appendix 1 (under the heading: Superhuman Numerical Combinations). Putting the number of every verse in the Quran in sequence from the beginning to the end, with the number of verses in each sura ahead of the verse numbers of each sura, the final number consists of 12692 digits (19x668), and the number itself is also a multiple of 19. If the wrong number of verses for Sura 9 was used - 129 instead of 127 - neither the number of digits, nor the number itself would be divisible by 19. 
[63] Since the subject of this Appendix is Sura 9 and its number of true verses, it is noteworthy that if we write down the number of the sura, 9, followed by the correct number of verses, 127, followed by the numbers of all the verses from 1 to 127, the resulting long number is a multiple of 19. Needless to 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1406 -----------------------------------------------------
say, if the wrong number of verses is used, i.e., 129 instead of 127, this remarkable miracle would have disappeared: 
9 127 1 2 3 4 5 ..... 122 123 124 125 126 127. 
The total number of verses in Sura 9 is followed by the numbers of every verse in the sura from 1 to 127. The resulting long number is a multiple of 19. 
[64] The number of verses in Sura 9 , 127, is an odd number. The falsifiers added two fake verses, and this made the number of verses 129, which is also an odd number. Mr. Arik used the same computer program he devised for Item 62 above to check all odd-numbered verses in the Quran. Thus, the number of verses in every sura was written down, followed only by the last digit of each of the odd- numbered verses in that sura. Sura 1 was represented by the number 71357. Sura 2 was represented 
by the number 28613579.....5, and so on through the last sura. The result is a long number, with 3371 
digits, that is divisible by 19. Obviously, Sura 9 was represented by the number 12713579......7: 
7 1 3 5 7 286 1 3 5 ... 3 5 ...... 5 1 3 5 6 1 3 5. 
The number of verses in every sura is followed by the numbers of the odd-numbered verses. The resulting long number, 3371 digits, is a multiple of 19. 
[65] Since Sura 9 is an un-initialed sura, Mr. Arik applied the same computer program to all 85 un- initialed suras. The number of every verse in each of the 85 suras was written down, without the number of verses in the sura. Thus, Sura 1 was represented by the number 1234567, not 71234567. This was done with all un-initialed suras. The final result is a number that consists of 6635 digits, and is a multiple of 19. These awesome phenomena would be destroyed if we used the wrong number of verses for Sura 9 , i.e., 129 instead of 127. 
God's Messenger of the Covenant Destined to 
Purify the Quran 
[66] Finally, in a profound demonstration of the foreknowledge of the Almighty Author of the Quran, it is mathematically coded that "The person destined to prove that Sura 9 consists of 127 verses is Rashad Khalifa, God's Messenger of the Covenant" (see Appendix 2 ). The item presented here is another one of those numerous proofs; it is chosen for its relevance to this Appendix. 
The gematrical value of the word "Rashad," as written in the Quran ( 40:29 , 38) is 505 (R=200, Sh=300, A=1, and D=4). The gematrical value of the word "Khalifa," as written in the Quran ( 38:26 ) is 725 (Kh=600, L=30, I=10, F=80, and H=5). By writing down the value of "Rashad," followed by the value of "Khalifa," followed by the number of Sura 9 , followed by the correct number of verses in this sura, the product is 5057259127. This number is a multiple of 19; it equals 19x266171533. 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1407 -----------------------------------------------------
[67] The number of verses from 3:81 , where God's Messenger of the Covenant is prophesied, to 9:127 , the end of Sura 9 , is 988 (19x52). Table 41. 
[68] The sum of verse numbers from 3:81 to 9:127 is also a multiple of 19 (Table 41).

[69] In Verse 3:78 , just 3 verses before proclaiming God's Messenger of the Covenant, the word "God" number 361 (19x19) occurs. This verse ( 3:78 ) informs us that some falsifiers will "add falsehood to the Quran, then claim that it is part of the Quran; they attribute lies to God, knowingly." 
[70] The word "God" occurs 912 times (19x48) from Verse 3:78 , which exposes the falsifiers, to 9:127 . 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1409 -----------------------------------------------------
[71] The number of letters, plus the number of words in 3:78 and in the false verses 9:128-129, give the same total, 143. Verse 3:78 consists of 27 words and 116 letters, & 9:128-129 consist of 115 letters and 28 words. 
What Can We Say? 
The overwhelming physical evidence provided by the Almighty to protect and authenticate His message leaves no doubt that: (1) no distortion of any kind can enter the Quran, (2) Verses 9:128-129 do not belong in the Quran, and (3) every element in the Quran is mathematically structured far beyond human capabilities - the number of suras, the number of verses, the numbers assigned to the suras and verses, the frequency of occurrence of key expressions, the number of words, the number of letters, and the unique and often uncommon spelling of certain words. 
This Appendix documents a profound miracle in its own right. Vast and utterly overwhelming as it is, it does not surpass or even match the overall mathematical miracle of the Quran which is detailed in Appendix One. This merely confirms the fact that the Almighty Author of the Quran has deliberately permitted the blasphemous addition of two verses to Sura 9 in order to: 
(1) Demonstrate an essential function of the Quran's mathematical composition. 
(2) Prove the impossibility of tampering with the Quran. 
(3) Ful ﬁll God's promise to distinguish the believers and expose the hypocrites. 
Why Did God Permit It For 1400 Years ?? 
Due to the mass corruption of Islam shortly after the prophet Muhammad's death, God obviously has fulfilled His pledge in 47:38 . A divine decree issued in Sura 47, which is entitled "Muhammad," Verse 38 (19x2), stipulates that "if the Arabs failed to uphold the Quran, God will dismiss them from His grace, and substitute other people in their place." 
When the Arabs distorted the Quran a few years after the Prophet's death, and exterminated the Prophet's family in the process, they incurred God's pledge of 47:38 , and no longer deserved to possess the Quran; the true Quran. The evidence is irrefutable that the Arabs have abandoned the Quran en masse. 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1410 -----------------------------------------------------
For example, there is not a single mosque in the so-called Muslim world today (1989) that upholds the crucial commandment: "The mosques belong to God; you shall not invoke anyone else besides God" ( 72:18 ). 
The call to prayer (Azan) and the prayer itself are no longer devoted to God alone; Muhammad's name is invariably invoked along with the name of God. 
The "First Pillar of Islam" is clearly stated in the Quran, 3:18 & 47:19 , and its words are decreed to be: LAA ELAAHA ELLA ALLAH (There is no other god besides God). But the Muslims, as early as the first century AH, do not want God if Muhammad is not invoked along with Him. This is easily demonstrable today by going into any mosque and declaring: " LAA ELAAHA ELLA ALLAH ;" this will actually enrage today's Muslims. This behavior is documented in the Quran, 39:45 . Moreover, my own research has now convinced me that the traditional Muslims are forbidden by God from uttering the Quranic, divinely dictated Shahaadah: "Ash-hadu Allaa Elaaha Ellaa Allah." They can never say this Shahaadah (without invoking Muhammad's name). Test them yourself. The First Pillar of the distorted Islam, LAA ELAAHA ELLA ALLAH, MUHAMMAD RASOOL ALLAH , does not conform with God's commandments that came to us through Muhammad (see Appendix 13 ). 
A number of other commandments are violated as well by this Mohammedan Shahaadah. For 
example, the Quran enjoins us repeatedly from making any distinction among God's messengers 
( 2:136 , 285; 3:84 ). The distorted Shahaadah gives more distinction to Muhammad, against his will. Despite the Quran's repeated assertions that it is "complete, perfect, and fully detailed" ( 6:19 , 38, & 114), the "Muslims" have refused to believe their Creator; they uphold such ridiculous and nonsensical sources as Hadith and Sunna. This unanimous rebellion against God and His messenger, and the mass reversion to glaring idolatry - idolizing the Prophet and the saints - called for fulfillment of God's pledge in 47:38 . 
In view of the incontrovertible divine evidence presented here, and in Appendices 1, 2, and 26, one can truly appreciate the following verses: 
Surely, we have revealed this message, and surely, we will preserve it. [ 15:9 ] 
Say, "If all the humans, and all the jinns, banded together, in order to produce a Quran like this, they will surely fail, no matter how much assistance they lend one another." [ 17:88 ] 
The disbelievers rejected this message when it came to them, though it is a profound scripture. No falsehood can enter it, through addition or deletion. For it is a revelation from the Most Wise, Most Praiseworthy. [ 41:41 -42 ] 
If we revealed this Quran to a mountain, you would see it trembling, crumbling, out of reverence for God. [ 59:21 ] 
I acknowledge with thanks the valuable contributions of Mahmoud Ali Abib, Gatut Adisoma, Abdullah Arik, Ihsan Ramadan, Lisa Spray, and Edip Yuksel. Some of the astounding mathematical facts presented in this Appendix were discovered by these hard working researchers at Masjid Tucson.

Appendix 25 
End Of The World 
(God is) the Knower of the future; He does not permit anyone to unveil such knowledge. Only through the messengers that He chooses does He reveal future and past events." [ 72:27 ] 
Among the duties charged to me as God's Messenger of the Covenant is unveiling the end of the world (Page 415). We learn from 18:7 -8 and 69:13 - 15 that this world will come to an end. A new earth and new heavens will replace the present heavens and earth ( 14:48 ). 
Signs of the Approaching End of the World 
The Quran provides many signs, and states that the means for unveiling the end of the world have been given ( 47:18 ). The signs given in the Quran include: 
1. The splitting of the moon: This already happened in June 1969 when we landed on the moon and brought back moon rocks. People on earth can go now to many museums, colleges and observatories to look at pieces of the moon. 2. Discovering the Quran's 19-based mathematical code ( 74:30 -37): Fulﬁlled in 1969-1974. 3. The creature ( 27:82 ): "Made from the earth, it alerts the people that they have been oblivious to their Creator." The Creature, made from the earth, did appear and was instrumental in unveiling the Quran's numerical code, and proclaiming that the world has neglected God's message; the creature is the computer. Note that the digits that make up 27:82 add up to 19. 4. Appearance of God's Messenger of the Covenant ( 3:81 ): As detailed in Appendix 2 , a consolidating messenger, prophesied in the Quran, comes after all the prophets have delivered the scriptures, to purify and unify. This prophecy was ful ﬁlled in Ramadan 1408. 5. The 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1412 -----------------------------------------------------
Smoke ( 44:10 ): occurs after God's Messenger of the Covenant has delivered the uni ﬁed message and proclaimed Islam (Submission) as the only religion acceptable by God. 6. Gog and Magog: they re-appear, in accordance with God's plan, in the year 1700 AH (2271 AD). Gog and Magog are mentioned in 18:94 and 21:96 . If you count the verses from 18:94 to the end of Sura 18 , you ﬁnd them 17. If you count the verses from 21:96 to the end of Sura 21 , you ﬁnd them also 17. This is the Quran's sign that Gog and Magog will re-appear in 1700 AH. 
It Will Not Remain Hidden [ 20:15 ] 
Verse 15 of Sura 20 informs us that the end of the world will be revealed by God before the end of the world, and Sura 15 , Verse 87, gives the time for that event: 
"We have given you the seven pairs, and the great Quran." [ 15:87 ] 
The seven pairs are the 14 Quranic Initials. The total gematrical value of these profound pillars of the Quran's miracle pinpoints the year of the end of the world. It is noteworthy that Verse 85 of Sura 15 states: "The end of the world will surely come to pass." The next verse, 15:86 , tells us that God is the Creator of this world, and, of course, He knows when it will end. The following verse, 15:87 , tells us when the world will end. As shown in Table 1, the gematrical values of "The Seven Pairs" of Quranic Initials total 1709 (see also Table 1 of Appendix 1 ). According to 15:87 , the world will survive for 1709 lunar years from the time this prophecy is stated in the Quran. This means that the world will end in the year 1710 AH. This number is a multiple of 19; 1710 = 19x90.

1709 
The unveiling of this information took place in the year 1400 AH, 309 years before the prophesied end of the world (1709-1400=309). The number 309 is a Quranic number (18:25), and is connected with the end of the world (18:21). The peculiar way of writing 309 in 18:25, "Three hundred years, increased by nine," indicates that the 309 are lunar years. The difference between 300 solar years and 300 lunar years is 9 years. 
The year of this discovery, 1400 AH, coincided with 1980 AD, and 1980 plus 300 solar years is 2280, also a multiple of 19, 19x120. Thus the world ends in 1710 AH, 19x90, which coincides with 2280 AD, 19x120. For the disbelievers who do not accept these powerful Quranic proofs, the end of the world will come suddenly ( 6:31 , 44, 47; 7:95 , 187; 12:107 ; 21:40 , 22:55 ; 26:202 ; 29:53 ; 39:55 ; 43:66 ; and 47:18 ). 
While Hadith is forbidden as a source of religious teachings (Appendix 19 ), it can be a useful source of history. We can derive a lot of information about historical events and local customs and traditions during the early centuries of Islam. The books of Hadith indicate that the Quranic Initials were 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1414 -----------------------------------------------------
believed to determine the life span of the Muslim Ummah. The classic exegesis by Al-Baydaawy cites the following historical event as a possible explanation of the Quranic Initials. The same event is detailed in Al- Suyooty's ITQAAN, First Printing, 1318 AH, Vol 2, Page 10: 
The Jews of Medina went to the Prophet and said, "Your Quran is initialed with A.L.M., and these Initials determine the life span of your religion. Since `A' is 1, `L' is 30, and `M' is 40, this means that your religion will survive only 71 years." Muhammad said, "We also have A.L.M.S." They said, "The `A' is 1, the `L' is 30, the `M' is 40, and the `S' is 90. This adds up to 161. Do you have anything else?" The Prophet said, "Yes, A.L.M.R." They said, "This is longer and heavier; the `A' is 1, `L' is 30, `M' is 40, and `R' is 200, making the total 271." They ﬁnally gave up, saying, "We do not know how many of these Initials he was given!" [Al-Suyuty's Famous Reference ITQAAN] 
Although this narration is well known, many scholars have been reluctant to accept the unmistakable connection between the Quranic Initials and the end of the world. They could not bring themselves to deal with this subject for the simple reason that the calculation makes the end of the world, and judgment, a reality.

Appendix 26 
The Three Messengers of Islam 
This Appendix provides the Quranic mathematical evidence that [1] Abraham was the original messenger of Islam, i.e, Submission ( 22:78 ), [2] Muhammad was the scripture delivering messenger ( 47:2 ), and [3] Rashad is the purifying and consolidating messenger who delivered the religion's authenticating proof ( 3:81 , & Appendix 2). 
Perpetual and Veriﬁable Evidence 
[1] As pointed out in Appendix 2 , the gematrical value of "Abraham" is 258, the gematrical value of "Muhammad" is 92, the gematrical value of "Rashad" is 505, and 258+92+505 =855 = 19x45. 
[2] If we include "Ismail," whose gematrical value is 211 and "Isaac," whose gematrical value is 169, we still end up with a total gematrical value of 855+211+169 = 1235 = 19x65. The total gematrical value of the three messengers, or the ﬁve, cannot conform with the Quran's 19-based mathematical code if either Abraham, Muhammad, or Rashad is not included. 
[3] The ﬁrst and last occurrences of "Abraham" are in 2:124 and 87:19 . By adding the sura numbers, plus the number of verses, plus the sum of verse numbers from the ﬁrst occurrence to the last occurrence, the grand total is 333260, 19x17540 (Table 1).

[4] As pointed out in Appendix 2 , the name of God's Messenger of the Covenant is introduced to the computer age through mathematical coding. If the name was speciﬁed in the Quran, as is the case with past messengers, millions of people would have named their children "Rashad Khalifa." Thus, the root word "Rashada" is mentioned in the Quran 19 times (Appendix 2 ). 
[5] "Abraham" is mentioned in 25 suras, "Muhammad" is mentioned in 4 suras, and "Rashada" occurs in 9 suras. The total of these suras is 25+4+9 = 38 = 19x2 (INDEX TO THE WORDS OF QURAN, Abdul Baqi). 
[6] If we add the numbers of the suras where Abraham, Muhammad, and Rashada occur, plus the number of occurrences per sura, the total comes to 1083, 19x19x3 (Table 2).

[8] The sum of all sura numbers where the three words occur, without repetition, plus the sum of all the verse numbers, without repetition, add up to 6479, 19x341. The suras are 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 22, 26, 29, 33, 37, 38, 40, 42, 43, 47, 48, 49, 51, 53, 57, 60, 72, and 87. The sum of these numbers is 991 (see Table 3). The verses where the three words are mentioned, without repetition, are 2, 4, 6, 7, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 21, 24, 26, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 38, 40, 41, 43, 45, 46, 51, 54, 58, 60, 62, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 74, 75, 76, 78, 83, 84, 87, 95, 97, 104, 109, 114, 120, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 130, 132, 133, 135, 136, 140, 144, 146, 161, 163, 186, 256, 258, and 260. The sum of these numbers is 5488, and: 5488 + 991 = 6479 = 19x341. 
[9] If we add the sura number, plus the verse number, plus the number of verses where Abraham, Muhammad, and Rashada occur, we get a grand total that equals 7505, 19x395 (Table 4).

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1420 -----------------------------------------------------
Thus, it is mathematically coded into the Quran that Abraham, Muhammad, and Rashad are the three messengers of Islam (Submission). 
[10] As shown in Table 4, the 19 occurrences of the root word "Rashada" are in verses 186, 256, 6, 146, 78, 87, 97, 10, 17, 24, 66, 51, 29, 38, 7, 2, 20, 14, and 21. These are 38 digits, 19x2. 
[11] Table 4 shows that the sum of the verse numbers where we see the 19 occurrences of the root word "Rashada" is 1145. By adding this total of verse numbers (1145), to the gematrical value of the name "Rashad" (505), plus the gematrical value of the name "Khalifa" (725), we get 1145+505+725 = 2375, 19x125. 
[12] If we write down these numbers next to each other, i.e., the total of verse numbers (1145), followed by the gematrical value of the name "Rashad" (505), followed by the gematrical value of the name "Khalifa" (725), we also get a number that is a multiple of 19: 1145505725 = 19x60289775. 
Sum of Verse Numbers Where the 19 "Rashada" Occur = 1145 
Gematrical Value of the Name "Rashad" = 505 
Gematrical Value of the Name "Khalifa" = 725 
1145 + 505 + 725 = 2375 = 19 x 125 
1145 505 725 = 1145505725 = 19 x 60289775

Appendix 27 
Who Is Your God? 
Most people are outraged upon hearing this question. "What do you mean, `Who is your god?' they ask, `My god is the Creator of the heavens and the earth.' " And most of these people will be shocked to ﬁnd out that their proclamation that their god is the Creator of the heavens and the earth is no more than lip service, and that they are in fact destined for Hell ( 12:106 ). 
Your god is whoever or whatever occupies your mind most of the time. 
Your god can be your children ( 7:190 ), your spouse ( 9:24 ), your business ( 18:35 ), or your ego ( 25:43 ). This is why we note that one of the most important and most repeated commandments in the Quran is: 
"O you who believe, you shall remember God frequently; glorify Him day and night." [ 33:41 ] 
To put this commandment into practice, we must establish certain habits whereby we guarantee that God occupies our minds more than anything else. The Quran helps us establish such soul saving habits: 
1. The Contact Prayers (Salat) : those who observe the 5 daily prayers come a long way towards commemorating God a signiﬁcant proportion of their waking hours. Salat helps us remember God not only during the few minutes of prayer, but also throughout the times of anticipation. At 11:00 AM, one may look at his or her watch to see if the noon prayer is due yet. This act causes one to think about God, and one is credited accordingly ( 20:14 ). 
2. Commemorate God before eating : Verse 6:121 enjoins us to mention God's name before we eat: "You shall not eat from that upon which God's 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1422 -----------------------------------------------------
name has not been mentioned." 
3. God Willing ( IN SHAA ALLAH ): "You shall not say, `I will do this or that tomorrow,' without saying, `God willing' (IN SHAA ALLAH). If you forget to do this, then apologize and say, `May my Lord guide me to do better next time.'" [ 18:24 ]. This is a direct commandment that we must carry out, no matter who we are talking with. 
4. God's Gift ( MAA SHAA ALLAH ): To invoke God's protection for our beloved objects - our children, our cars, our homes, etc. - we are enjoined in 18:39 to say "MAA SHAA ALLAH" (This is God's gift). 
5. Glorify God day and night : When we eat anything, we shouldn't be like animals; we must re ﬂect on God's creation of the food we are eating - the ﬂavor, our enjoyment due to the senses God has given us, the perfect packaging of the banana or the orange, the varieties of sea foods created by God, etc. - and glorify Him as we enjoy His provisions. When we see a beautiful ﬂower, or animal, or sunsets, we must glorify God. We must seize every possible opportunity to remember and glorify God, so that God may be our God. 
6. First Utterance : Make it a habit to say: "In the name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful. There is no other god besides God," the moment you wake up every morning. If you establish this good habit, this is what you will utter when you are resurrected.

Appendix  28 
Muhammad Wrote God's Revelations With His Own Hand 
The ﬁrst revelation was "Read," and included the statement "God teaches by means of the pen" ( 96:1 -4), and the second revelation was "The Pen" ( 68:1 ). The only function of the pen is to write. 
Ignorant Muslim scholars of the ﬁrst two centuries after the Quran could not understand the Quran's challenge to produce anything like it. They had no idea about the Quran's mathematical composition, and they knew that many literary giants could have composed works comparable to the Quran. In fact, many such literary giants did claim the ability to produce a literary work as excellent as the Quran. The latest claim came from Taha Hussein, the renowned Egyptian writer. 
The ignorant Muslim scholars then decided to proclaim Muhammad an illiterate man! They ﬁgured that this would make the Quran's extraordinary literary excellence truly miraculous. The word they relied on to bestow illiteracy upon the Prophet was "UMMY." Unfortunately for those "scholars," this word clearly means "Gentile," or one who does not follow any scripture (Torah, Injeel, or Quran) [see  2:78 ,  3:20  & 75,  62:2 ]; it does NOT mean "illiterate." 
The Prophet was a successful merchant. The "Muslim scholars" who fabricated the illiteracy lie forgot that there were no numbers during the Prophet's time; the letters of the alphabet were used as numbers. As a merchant dealing with numbers every day, the Prophet had to know the alphabet, from one to one-thousand. 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1424 -----------------------------------------------------
The Quran tells us that Muhammad wrote down the Quran - Muhammad's contemporaries are quoted as saying, "These are tales from the past that he wrote down. They are being dictated to him day and night" ( 25:5 ). You cannot "dictate" to an illiterate person. The Prophet's enemies who accuse him of illiteracy abuse Verse  29:48 , which relates speciﬁcally to previous scriptures. 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1425 -----------------------------------------------------
On the 27th night of Ramadan 13 B.H. (Before Hijerah), Muhammad the soul, the real person, not the body, was summoned to the highest universe and the Quran was given to him ( 2:97 ,  17:1 ,  44:3 ,  53:1 -18,  97:1 -5). Subsequently, the angel Gabriel helped Muhammad release a few verses of the Quran at a time, from the soul to Muhammad's memory. The Prophet wrote down and memorized the verses just released into his mind. When the Prophet died, he left the complete Quran written down with his own hand in the chronological order of revelation, along with speciﬁc instructions as to where to place every verse. The divine instructions recorded by the Prophet were designed to put the Quran together into the ﬁnal format intended for God's Final Testament to the world ( 75:17 ). The early Muslims did not get around to putting the Quran together until the time of Khalifa Rashed `Uthmaan. A committee was appointed to carry out this task. Read Appendix  24  for the details.

Appendix 29 
The Missing Basmalah 
Every sura in the Quran opens with the statement "In the name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful," known as the Basmalah, with the exception of Sura 9 . This conspicuous absence of the Basmalah from Sura 9 has been an intriguing feature of the Quran for 14 centuries. Many theories have been advanced to explain this phenomenon. 
Now we learn that the missing Basmalah plays a signiﬁcant role as [1] a signiﬁcant constituent of the Quran's mathematical miracle, and [2] a glaring sign from the Most Gracious, Most Merciful, that Sura 9 has been tampered with and must be puriﬁed (Appendix 24 ). Both roles of the missing Basmalah were revealed with the discovery of the Quran's mathematical code. The following list of factual observations illustrate the miraculous features of the missing Basmalah:

(19x27) 
[1] Since the Basmalah consists of 19 Arabic letters, and preﬁxes all the suras except one, it can be considered the foundation upon which the Quran's 19-based code is built. But the absence of the Basmalah from Sura 9 causes the number of this crucial opening statement to be 113, a number that does not conform with the Quran's code. However, we ﬁnd that this deﬁciency is compensated for in Sura 27 . Two Basmalahs occur in Sura 27 , one as an opener and one in Verse 30. This restores the total number of Basmalahs in the Quran to 114, 19x6. 
[2] From the missing Basmalah of Sura 9 to the extra Basmalah of Sura 27 , there are 19 suras. 
[3] The sum of sura numbers from the missing Basmalah (Sura 9 ) to the extra Basmalah (Sura 27 ) is 9+10+11+12+ ... +25+26+27 = 342, 19x18. This is a mathematical property, any consecutive 19 numbers will add up to a multiple of 19. But the miraculous phenomenon is that this number, 342, equals the number of words from the ﬁrst Basmalah of Sura 27 to the second Basmalah in 27:30 . 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1428 -----------------------------------------------------
[4] The occurrence of the extra Basmalah in 27:30 conforms with the Quran's code in that the sura number, plus the verse number is a multiple of 19 (27+30 = 57 = 19x3). 
[5] The occurrence of the extra Basmalah in Verse 30 compares with the occurrence of the number 19 itself in Verse 30 (Sura 74 ). 
[6] The Quran contains 6234 numbered verses. The absence of the Basmalah from Sura 9 , and compensating for it in Verse 30 of Sura 27 gives us two numbered Basmalahs, 1:1 & 27:30 , and 112 un-numbered Basmalahs. This causes the total number of verses in the Quran to be 6234+112 = 6346, 19x334. 
[7] From the missing Basmalah to the extra Basmalah, the number of verses containing the word "Allah" is 513, 19x27. Note that 27 is the sura number where the extra Basmalah occurs. The data are in Table 1. 
[8] The sum of verse numbers (1+2+3+ ... +n), plus the number of verses, from the missing Basmalah to the extra Basmalah is 119624, 19x6296. See Table 2.

[9] This item also proves that Sura 9 consists of 127 verses, not 129 (see Appendix 24 ). The sum of digits of 127 is 1+2+7=10. By ﬁnding all the verses whose digits add up to 10, from the missing Basmalah of Sura 9 to the extra Basmalah of Sura 27 , then adding the number of these verses to the total number of verses from the missing Basmalah to the extra Basmalah, we get 2128, or 19x112 (Table 3). 
[10] Sura 9 is an odd-numbered sura whose number of verses (127) is also odd. From the missing Basmalah to the extra Basmalah, there are 7 suras that possess this property; they are odd-numbered suras whose numbers of verses are also odd. As detailed in Table 4, these are Suras 9 , 11 , 13 , 15 , 17 , 25 , and 27 . By adding the digits that make up the sura numbers and the numbers of verses, the grand total is 114, 19x6.

[11] The next two features authenticate both the missing Basmalah and the number of verses in Sura 9 (where two false verses had been injected). If we take the same suras listed in Table 4, odd-numbered suras whose numbers of verses are also odd, and write down the number of every sura, followed by its number of verses, the resulting long number (30 digits) is a multiple of 19 (Figure 1). 
[12] Let us take the last digit of all the verses from the missing Basmalah to the extra Basmalah. If we write down the number of every sura, followed by the last digit in every verse in that sura, we end up with a long number, of 1988 digits, which is divisible by 19 (Figure 2).

Appendix  30 
Polygamy 
Polygamy was a way of life until the Quran was revealed 1400 years ago. When the earth was young and under-populated, polygamy was one way of populating it and bringing in the human beings needed to carry out God's plan. By the time the Quran was revealed, the world had been suf ﬁciently populated, and the Quran put down the ﬁrst limitations against polygamy. 
Polygamy is permitted in the Quran, but under strictly observed circumstances. Any abuse of this divine permission incurs severe retribution. Thus, although polygamy is permitted by God, it behooves us to examine our circumstances carefully before saying that a particular polygamous relationship is permissible. 
Our perfect example here is the prophet Muhammad. He was married to one wife, Khadijah, until she died. He had all his children, except one, from Khadijah. Thus, she and her children enjoyed the Prophet's full attention for as long as she was married to him; twenty- ﬁve years. For all practical purposes, Muhammad had one wife - from the age of 25 to 50. During the remaining 13 years of his life, he married the aged widows of his friends who left many children. The children needed a complete home, with a fatherly ﬁgure, and the Prophet provided that. Providing a fatherly ﬁgure for orphans is the only speciﬁc circumstance in support of polygamy mentioned in the Quran ( 4:3 ). 
Other than marrying widowed mothers of orphans, there were three political marriages in the Prophet's life. His close friends Abu Bakr and Omar insisted that he marry their daughters, Aisha and Hafsah, to establish traditional family ties among them. The third marriage was to Maria the Egyptian; she was given to him as a political gesture of friendship from the ruler of Egypt. 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1433 -----------------------------------------------------
This perfect example tells us that a man must give his full attention and loyalty in marriage to his wife and children in order to raise a happy and wholesome family. 
The Quran emphasizes the limitations against polygamy in very strong words: "If you fear lest you may not be perfectly equitable in treating more than one wife, then you shall be content with one." ( 4:3 ) "You cannot be equitable in a polygamous relationship, no matter how hard you try." ( 4:129 ) 
The Quranic limitations against polygamy point out the possibility of abusing God's law. Therefore, unless we are absolutely sure that God's law will not be abused, we had better resist our lust and stay away from polygamy. If the circumstances do not dictate polygamy, we had better give our full attention to one wife and one set of children. The children's psychological and social well-being, especially in countries where polygamy is prohibited, almost invariably dictate monogamy. A few basic criteria must be observed in contemplating polygamy: 
1. It must alleviate pain and suffering and not cause any pain or suffering. 
2. If you have a young family, it is almost certain that polygamy is an abuse. 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1434 -----------------------------------------------------
3. Polygamy to substitute a younger wife is an abuse of God's law ( 4:19 ).

Appendix 31 
Evolution: Divinely Controlled We learn from the Quran that evolution is a divinely designed fact: 
Life began in water: "From water we initiated all living things." ( 21:30 , 24:45 ) 
Humans not descendants of monkeys: "He started the creation of man mud." ( 32:7 ) 
Man created from "aged" mud: "I am creating the human being from aged' clay." ( 15:28 ) 
Evolution is possible only within a given species. For example, the navel orange evolved from seeded oranges, not from apples. The laws of probablity preclude the possibility of haphazard evolution between species. A ﬁsh cannot evolve into a bird; a monkey can never evolve into a human. 
Probability Laws Preclude Darwin's Evolution 
In this computer age, we have mathematical laws that tell us whether a certain event is probable or not. If we throw ﬁve numbered cubes up in the air and let them fall into a guided straight line, the probability laws tell us the number of possible combinations we can get: 1x2x3x4x5=120 combinations. Thus, the probability of obtaining any combination is 1 in 120, or 1/120, or 0.0086. This probability diminishes fast when we increase the number of cubes. If we increase them by one, the number of 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1436 -----------------------------------------------------
combinations becomes 1x2x3x4x5x6=720, and the probability of getting any combination diminishes to 1/720, 0.0014. Mathematicians, who are very exacting scientists, have agreed that the probability diminishes to "Zero" when we increase the number of cubes to 84. If we work with 84 cubes, the probability diminishes to 209x10 (raised to the power of) -50, or 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000209 
Darwin's famous statement that "life began as a `simple' cell" is laughable. As recently as 50 years ago, Wells, Huxley, and Wells wrote in their classic textbook that "nothing can be seen inside the nucleus but clear ﬂuid." We know now that the cell, is an extremely complex unit, with billions of nucleotides in the gene material inside the nucleus, and millions of biochemical reactions. The probability laws tell us that the probability of the haphazard creation of the exacting sequences of nucleotides into DNA is Zero, many times over. We are not talking about 84 nucleotides; we are talking about billions of nucleotides that must be arranged in a speci ﬁc sequence. 
Some evolutionists have stated that the human gene and the monkey's gene are 90% similar. However, even if the similarity was 99%, we are still talking about 300,000,000 nucleotides that must be haphazardly re-arranged to change the monkey into a human. The probability laws preclude this as an utter impossibility. The human gene contains 30,000,000,000 nucleotides; 1% of that is 300,000,000. 
A ﬁtting quote here is that of Professor Edwin Conklin; he stated: 
The probability of life originating from accident is comparable to the probability of the Unabridged Dictionary resulting from an explosion in a printing factory.

Appendix  32 
The Crucial Age of 40 
What is the age of responsibility? If a child dies at the age of 12, without even hearing about God, does this child go to Heaven or Hell? What if the child is 15 years old, or 21, or 25? At what age will the human being be held responsible for his or her beliefs? This question has puzzled researchers of all religions for a long time. 
The Quran sets the age of responsibility at 40; anyone who dies before this age goes to Heaven ( 46:15 ). If the person believed in God and beneﬁted from belief by nourishing and developing the soul (see Appendix  15 ), he or she goes to the High Heaven. Otherwise, the person goes to the Lower Heaven. 
Your ﬁrst reaction to this piece of information is objection: "What if the person was really bad, evil, and an atheist, will he go to Heaven if he died before the age of 40?" This is because you are mean, while God is the Most Merciful. Our tendency is to "put them all in Hell." 
People who objected strongly to this Divine mercy cannot come up with a cut-off age of responsibility. They ask questions like, "What if the person was really wicked?" The answer is, "Does God know that this person was wicked?" "Yes." "Does God know that this person does not deserve to go to Heaven?" "Yes." "Therefore, this person will not die before the age of 40." As simple as that. God is the only one who terminates our lives on this earth. He knows exactly who deserves to go Heaven and who deserves to go to Hell. 
Early in 1989 a man by the name of Theodore Robert Bundy was executed for killing a number of women. The whole nation agreed that he was one of the most vicious criminals in history. So much so that his execution was one 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1438 -----------------------------------------------------
of the rare occasions where the opponents of capital punishment did not protest. On the contrary, many people actually celebrated his execution. Numerous journalists, editorials, and politicians lamented the fact that justice took eleven years to execute Ted Bundy. They stated that Bundy should have been executed within a maximum of six years after his conviction. According to the Quran, this would have been the greatest favor anyone could have done to Bundy. He was 42 years old when executed. Had he been executed ﬁve years earlier, at the age of 37, he would have gone straight to Heaven, and he did not deserve that. 
As it turns out, Bundy was one of the signs God has given us to con ﬁrm that anyone who dies before 40 goes to Heaven. Bundy's name, Theodore Robert Bundy, consists of 19 letters, and he confessed to killing 19 women just one day before his execution. There were many other signs from God. 
Delivering this important piece of information is one of the responsibilities given to me as God's Messenger of the Covenant. It is not my personal opinion.

It is noteworthy that both Martin Luther King and Malcolm X were assassinated just a couple of months before their 40th birthdays.

Appendix 33 
Why Did God Send A Messenger 
Now? 
As stated in 3:81 , and in Appendix 2 , God has sent a messenger to consolidate the messages delivered by all the prophets, purify them, and unify them into one religion: Submission. The timing is certainly ripe for fulﬁllment of this important prophecy, for the following reasons: 
1. Judaism, Christianity, and Islam have been corrupted beyond recognition. 
2. All God's messages have been delivered; the Quran is the Final Testament. 
3. More than 93% of the human beings destined to live in this world are yet to come. As illustrated in the Introduction, the people who have lived on this earth since Adam are only one- ﬁfteenth of the total projected human population. 
Judaism 
The best illustration of today's corrupted Judaism can be found in the books of a famous Rabbi; Harold S. Kushner. In his best seller WHEN BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO GOOD PEOPLE, Avon Books, 1981, Rabbi Kushner states the following: 
..., we would be advised to take this world as seriously as we can, in case it turns out to be the only one we will ever have, and to look for meaning and justice here. 
(P. 29) 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1441 -----------------------------------------------------
Bad things do happen to good people in this world, but it is not God who wills it. God would like people to get what they deserve, but He cannot always arrange it. 
(P. 42) 
God does not reach down to interrupt the workings of laws of nature to protect the righteous from harm. This is a second area of our world which causes bad things to happen to good people, and God does not cause it and cannot stop it. 
(P. 58) 
God can't do everything, but He can do some important things. 
(P. 113) 
We can't ask Him to make us immune to disease, because He can't do that. 
(P. 125) 
I recognize His limitations. He is limited in what He can do by law of nature, and by the evolution of human nature and human moral freedom. 
(P. 134) 
Christianity 
If Jesus came back to life today, the Christians would crucify him. Outstanding Christian scholars have reached solid conclusions that today's Christianity has nothing to do with Jesus, and that its doctrine was mortally distorted at the infamous Nicene Conferences (325 A.D.). See THE MYTH OF GOD INCARNATE, Westminster Press, Philadelphia, 1977. 
Islam 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1442 -----------------------------------------------------
If Muhammad came back to this world, the "Muslims" would stone him to death. The religion they follow today has nothing to do with the Islam preached by Abraham and Muhammad. Everything the "Muslims" do is wrong: the First Pillar (Shahaadah), the call to Salat prayer (Azan), the ablution (Wudu), the daily Salat prayers, the Zakat charity, Hajj, and all other practices of Islam (see Appendices 2 , 13, & 15).

Appendix 34 
Virginity 
Sons and daughters of the true believers must be taught that their happiness throughout their lives depends on following God's law and preserving their chastity. This means that they must keep themselves for their spouses only, and never allow anyone else to touch them in a sexual manner ( 23:5 -6, 24:30 , 33:35 , 70:29 -30). 
Today's society is replete with powerful temptations. In America's society of the eighties, even parents start talking about boyfriends for their daughters and girlfriends for their sons. When they reach their teens, many parents even supply birth control means to their children. An alarming percentage of teenagers are sexually active, even though they are not physiologically mature, and without any moral limitations. Millions of illicit pregnancies and the tragedies associated with them, plus millions of tragic abortions, happen every month in the USA. 
Among the results of this moral breakdown: unwanted and unsupported children, delinquent and irresponsible fathers, criminals who have no regard for people's lives or properties, millions of social mis ﬁts, incurable genital herpes, incurable genital warts, devastating syphilis and gonorrhea, dysplasia, the killer AIDS, and new diseases never known before. 
What most people do not know is that this moral breakdown costs them dearly throughout their lives. For the only law that rules the world is God's law, and these ﬂagrant violations of God's law cost them a lot of misery and problems ( 20:124 ). 
The true believers who care about their children will advise them and remind them repeatedly and persistently ( 20:132 ) to keep their chastity. This means staying a virgin until their wedding night, then staying loyal to 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1447 -----------------------------------------------------
one's spouse - never committing adultery - for their own happiness. God's advice to keep our chastity, before and after marriage, is for our own good. God is the one who controls our health, wealth, and happiness or misery ( 53:43 , 48).

Drugs & Alcohol 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1449 -----------------------------------------------------
There is no compromise whatsoever regarding illicit drugs and alcoholic beverages; they are called "abominations and the work of Satan" ( 5:90 ). In  2:219  and  5:90 , we see that "intoxicants, gambling, the idols' altars, and games of chance" are strictly prohibited. The word used for intoxicants is "Khamr" from the root word "Khamara" which means "to cover." Thus, anything that covers or hinders the mind is prohibited. This includes anything that alters the mind, such as marijuana, heroin, cocaine, alcohol, hashish, and anything else that affects the mind.

Appendix 36 
What Price A Great Nation 
"If the people of the scripture (Jews, Christians, and Muslims) believe and maintain a righteous life, we will remit their sins and admit them into the blissful Heaven. Had they observed the Torah, the Gospel, and what is revealed herein from their Lord, they would have enjoyed provisions from above them, and from beneath their feet. Some of them are righteous, but most of them are evil doers." [ 5:65 -66] 
"If only the people of the various communities believed and maintained a righteous life, we would have showered them with blessings from the heaven and the earth" [ 7:96 ] 
"God is the One who controls your happiness, or misery. .... God is the 
One who makes you rich or poor." [ 53:43 , 48] 
A nation that upholds God's laws is guaranteed prominence among the nations of the world, victory, prosperity, and happiness ( 10:62 -64, 16:97 , 24:55 , 41:30 -31). On the other hand, a nation that violates God's laws incurs a miserable life ( 20:124 ). A nation that upholds God's laws is guaranteed to be a great nation. This is not a mere idealistic dream; since God is in full control ( 10:61 ), His guarantees and promises are done. A nation that upholds God's laws is characterized by: 
1. Maximum freedom for the people - freedom of religion, freedom of expression, freedom to travel, and freedom of economy ( 2:256 , 10:99 , 88:21 -22). 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1451 -----------------------------------------------------
2. Guaranteed human rights for all the people, regardless of their race, color, creed, social status, ﬁnancial situation, or political afﬁliation ( 5:8 , 49:13 ). 
3. Prosperity for all the people. God's economic system is based on constant circulation of wealth, no usury, and productive investment. Non-productive economy such as gambling, lottery, and high interest loans are not permitted ( 2:275 -7, 59:7 ). 
4. Social justice for all. Because of the obligatory charity (Zakat), no one will go hungry or un-sheltered ( 2:215 , 70:24 -25, 107:1 -7). 
5. A political system that is based on unanimous consensus. Through mutual consultation and freedom of expression, one side of any given issue convinces all participants in the discussion. The end result is a unanimous agreement, not the opinion of a 51% majority rammed down the throat of the 49% minority ( 42:38 ). 
6. A society that upholds and maintains the highest standards of moral behavior. There will be a strong family, no alcoholism, no illicit drugs, no illegitimate pregnancies, no abortions, and practically no divorce. 
7. Maximum regard for people's lives and properties. Therefore, there will be no crime against the people's lives or properties. 
8. Prevalence of love, courtesy, peace, and mutual respect among the people, and between this nation and other world communities ( 3:110 , 60:8 - 9). 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1452 -----------------------------------------------------
9. Environmental protection is guaranteed through conservation and prohibition of wasteful practices ( 30:41 ).

Appendix  37 
Criminal Justice 
If a thief steals a thousand dollars from you, and they put him in prison, what do you get? If the thief has a wife and children, what is their crime? Why should they be deprived of their father? 
The Quran solves this problem, as well as the problems associated with the criminal justice systems prevalent in today's world. 
Equivalence is the Law [ 2:178 -179] 
According to the Quranic criminal justice, the thief who is convicted of stealing a thousand dollars from you must work for you until you are fully paid for the thousand dollars you lost, plus any other damage and inconvenience the theft may have caused you. At the same time, the thief's innocent wife and children are not deprived of their man, and the expensive prison system is eliminated. Imprisonment is a cruel and inhumane punishment that has proven useless to all concerned. 
Contrary to common belief, the thief's hand shall not be cut off. Thank God for His mercy and His mathematical miracle in the Quran, we know now that the thief's hand is to be marked. Marking the hand of the thief is stated in  5:38 . The sura and verse numbers add up to 5+38 = 43. The other place in the Quran where "the hand is cut" is found in  12:31 . This is where we see the women who admired Joseph so much, they "cut" their hands. Obviously, they did not sever their hands; no one can do that. The sura and verse numbers add up to 12+31=43, the same total as in  5:38 . This gives mathematical conﬁrmation that the Quranic law calls for marking the hand of the thief, not severing it. Additional mathematical conﬁrmation is provided: 19 verses after  12:31 , we see the "cutting of the hand" again. 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1454 -----------------------------------------------------
Punishment in Islam (Submission) is based on equivalence and social pressure ( 2:178 ,  5:38 ,  24:2 ). 
The blasphemy called "Hadith & Sunna" has instituted stoning to death as the punishment for married adulterers. This is not God's law. As stated in  24:2 , the punishment for adultery is whipping in public; a hundred symbolic lashes. As pointed out above, the basic punishment is social pressure and scandalizing the criminal. Whipping in public achieves this goal. 

----------------------------------------------------- Page 1455 -----------------------------------------------------
In dealing with murder, the Quran de ﬁnitely discourages capital punishment ( 2:179 ). "The free for the free, the slave for the slave, and the female for the female" ( 2:178 ). Due to human meanness and injustice, many people cannot even imagine what this Quranic law says. They refuse to accept the clear injunctions that strict equivalence must be observed - if a woman kills a man, or a man kills a woman, or a slave kills a free person, or a free person kills a slave, capital punishment cannot be applied. The Quran prefers that the murderer compensate the victim's family. Killing the murderer does not bring the victim back, nor does the family of the victim bene ﬁt from executing the murderer. The compensation, however, must be sufﬁcient to be a deterrent for others. In Islam (Submission), the victim and/or the victim's family are the judges for all crimes; they decide what the punishment shall be under the supervision of a person who knows the Quran.

19: The Creator's Signature 
The scriptures are not the only mathematically composed creations of God where the number 19 is the common denominator. It is profound indeed that Galileo made his famous statement: "Mathematics is the language with which God created the universe." A plethora of scientiﬁc ﬁndings have now shown that the number 19 represents God's signature upon certain creations. This divine stamp appears throughout the universe in much the same manner as the signature of Michelangelo and Picasso identify their works. For example: 
1. The sun, the moon, and the earth become aligned in the same relative positions once every 19 years (see ENCYCLOPEDIA JUDAICA under "Calendar"). 
2. Halley's comet, a profound heavenly phenomenon, visits our solar system every 76 years, 19x4. 
3. God's stamp on you and me is manifested in the fact that the human body contains 209 bones, 19x11.

4. LANGMAN'S MEDICAL EMBRYOLOGY, by T. W. Sadler, is used as a textbook in most of the Medical Schools in the U.S.A. On Page 88 of the Fifth edition, we read the following statement: "In general the length of pregnancy for a full term fetus is considered to be 280 days or 40 weeks after onset of the last menstruation, or more accurately, 266 days or 38 weeks after fertilization." The numbers 266 and 38 are both multiples of 19.

From the same author 
Quran , Hadith and Islam(2009) 
After more than 12 years of computerized research of Quran, PHYSICAL EVIDENCE was discovered proving that Quran is indeed the infallible word of God. This discovery became very popular among the Muslim masses throughout the world, and summaries of the work were printed and distributed by the millions. My personal popularity soared along with this most exciting, and most humbling, discovery. 
The continued research then unveiled a startling fact; that the extremely popular "Hadith & Sunna" have nothing to do with the prophet Muhammad, and that adherence thereto represents ﬂagrant disobedience of God and His ﬁnal prophet (Quran 6:112 & 25:31). 
This ﬁnding contradicts the beliefs of Muslim masses everywhere. Consequently, my personal popularity, and even the popularity of the Quran's miracle, plunged to the point of endangering my life and reputation. As it turned out, telling the Muslims that "Hadith & Sunna" are Satanic inventions is the same as telling the Christians that Jesus is not the son of God. 
Since the recognition of "Hadith & Sunna" as Satanic innovations is supported by PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, all freethinking people will accept the ﬁndings reported in this book. For such people, the results include a totally new sense of salvation, and full awareness that the Muslim masses have fallen victim to Satan's schemes.
